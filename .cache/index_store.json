This time CL took an age to return a result in comparison to GC. The result from CL was pretty poor in terms of being able to use right away.

But it embedded HTML encoded characters, meaning it could not be used right away. GC on the other hand returned some tests that could be used immediately, but the tests it did return were wrong for the context of the function. Three tests only worked if you had supplied a number to the function to test the results, it hadn't taken the context of the function we provided in to consideration (even though GC is supposed to be able to read the open files in VS Code).

each of the edge cases you identified earlier, such as testing that the function returns an empty array when given an empty array or a single number.> 2.For example, to test that the function returns an empty array when given an empty array, you could write the following test:\n\n```javascript\ntest(\"returns an empty array when given an empty array\", () => {\n  expect(getFizzBuzz([])).toStrictEqual([]);\n});\n```\n\n> 1.To test that the function returns the correct output for a single number, you could write the following test:\n\n```javascript\ntest(\"returns an array with the correct output for a single number\", () => {\n  expect(getFizzBuzz([1])).toStrictEqual([1]);\n});\n```\n\n> 1.To test that the function returns the correct output for multiple numbers, you could write the following test:\n\n```javascript\ntest(\"returns an array with the correct output for multiple numbers\";, () => {\n  expect(getFizzBuzz([1, 2, 3])).toStrictEqual([1, 2, \"Fizz\"]);\n});\n\n```\n\n> 1.Finally, you can run your tests using the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm test\n```\n\n> This will run all of your

Eleventy also known as 11ty it's a fast Static Site Generator (SSG) that uses NodeS.It converts in my case Markdown files into a fast, easy to maintain blog that I've used since Jan 2021.As per usual upgrading to it was easy.So what's new?- ESM (ECMAScript Modules) support - so now you can use `import` and `export` in your templates!- It's smaller, has fewer dependencies, and is faster to install.- Plus a whole lot of other goodies\n\nThe upgrade plugin makes it super easy to upgrade.First up I wanted to take advantage of ESM syntax.I renamed my `eleventy.config.js` to `eleventy.config.mjs`.Installed the helper plugin by running:\n\n```sh\nnpm install @11ty/eleventy-upgrade-help@3\n```\n\nAdded the upgrade plugin to the `eleventy.config.mjs` file.Commit here\n\n```js\nimport UpgradeHelper from \"@11ty/eleventy-upgrade-help\";\n\n// Added the upgrade helper plugin  inside the default function\neleventyConfig.addPlugin(UpgradeHelper);\n```\n\nAsked GitHub Copilot to \"Update to esm syntax\" and made sure the `eleventy.config.mjs` file was referenced in the chat.That converted all my `require` statements into `import` statements.See the difference here between my previous v2 config to my v3 config.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"5JJ+ooBjTNfGValpcyOwg/+kGcHJRzXhUiA86HF4Hkc="},"bb267b7e-2b4a-4f4a-891d-430dafbb8e32":{"id_":"bb267b7e-2b4a-4f4a-891d-430dafbb8e32","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/another-easy-eleventy-upgrade.md","file_name":"another-easy-eleventy-upgrade.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/another-easy-eleventy-upgrade.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/another-easy-eleventy-upgrade.md","file_name":"another-easy-eleventy-upgrade.md","private":"false"},"hash":"0m5UuZ4S/qazM+QqBb8CWBF2Oc+EphqRQtvyBpEQ4Tg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f9582472-b9a1-4f8a-abff-df48dff36a70","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/another-easy-eleventy-upgrade.md","file_name":"another-easy-eleventy-upgrade.md","private":"false"},"hash":"5JJ+ooBjTNfGValpcyOwg/+kGcHJRzXhUiA86HF4Hkc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f46ffc62-0f15-4ec3-853d-a8d40b1fd98c","metadata":{},"hash":"B6zS46jsyWguvo3LInCueI7eI/A00zu7vDYAcVTRg9g="}},"text":"See

branch to test the preview build (got to love Netlify's setup).The preview build looked good too, so I merged it into main.All done and dusted in under an

course, open to suggestions, not the VLN handle.This is just one way to do it.So let's just jump into it, I think.So today's stream is going to be working on the design of a database.So not actually building it as such in any code or anything like that.going to use a tool called DB diagram and we're going to use that to help us design the database that we're going to put together for our LMS and we have a super base.Okay let's jump straight into that.So they're going to be pretty much sitting in Chrome for this whole demo.And I've gone here to DB diagram right here.So you can use this so free tool.I've used this many times in the past.I'm sure many of my past students remember going through using this.But it basically allows you to draw entity relationship diagrams in a nice little web tool and we'll just start getting into it I think.So let's sort of think back and sort of cast our minds back to what we've done previously.So we have created a table for Superbase and it's sitting here in the Table Editor and we've got a courses table.OK, so this is basically a table that we started last stream, which was about two weeks ago now.And in it we have a name and a description and an image for the course.and we can ID.So we can use that as one of the part of the design that we're going to be working on.So let's jump straight to DPDiagram and sort of get our heads in the game about how we're going to design this database.Okay so it's got a pretty simple format, you log in, you can use github login which is handy of course not having to create another account again and it's got like a basic demo here and it's talking about a product category and a product image and it's a nice sort of starting block there and it shows sort of the relationship here between these three tables So these are not the tables that we're going to use, but this is a good place to start so that we can sort of see how the tool works.So the tool is very much a.it's a representation of the database's tables and those relationships between them.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ckoRY/hITvm/EQYHbYRwrz2zTbiSNT0i/+VXWtOg860="},"5af03940-b023-4e12-a71b-4af39179a169":{"id_":"5af03940-b023-4e12-a71b-4af39179a169","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md","private":"false"},"hash":"jnJ2q0H0+RgGMqKC2g5AgQ0bDI5Re5jRZz3BMHtwSC8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"dc71d43c-13e5-4847-b57a-c710333d4316","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md","private":"false"},"hash":"5my0L8r2SdJR4iGrLp+az3uPetbRLp61GjTUlWuTNeI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"47e1f774-7305-482e-8465-434984ca471c","metadata":{},"hash":"vKIZDNkaSht+vvTJW7WZDLe1rcArcVQGjTkYFV12R/g="}},"text":"it's

clean easy to sort of follow tool.So let's clear this out so that we're starting from scratch.Okay so once I do that it's now got no tables in there.Okay and so we've got the courses table which is what I was showing before.So we can have a table, you don't need to know so much the syntax for this, it does have a bit of help here in the documentation.but you can get along pretty far just by sort of following the examples.Okay so give it a table name.So this isn't SQL as such, it's just a language that's used for the dp-diagram.io.I'm trying to remember what it is off the top of my head.I think it's DBML.Yes, DBML is a syntax for defining a database.So, Open Source Markout Language User Defined Database Schema Structure.DBML is also developed by the team behind DB diagram.So, all the help's in here.It's got the actual outline there of a basic table structure and how to do this relationship of some of the next page there.So let's go back to our diagram.So we've got a table, we've got courses.Next one I was showing before in the UI for Superbase.Again it's a very sort of simple sort of markup kind of language.So you've got the table name using a plural there for courses.And I need to have an ID.So I'm going to have a course ID.This is going to be a integer.So let's make sure that we do that the correct way.So it's an integer like that, int.And we can have the primary key there.That's what the PK stands for.So if we go like that.OK, it's got a little key icon there for the cross ID.So that's very much like what we've got for our existing table here.So the next field in there is a created at.Again, created it and this is going to be a timestamp.I believe that's the right type.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"qwWPVbEKhj7/w9qmMwkboSdw1tFsToxNqqeEN1dFCjQ="},"47e1f774-7305-482e-8465-434984ca471c":{"id_":"47e1f774-7305-482e-8465-434984ca471c","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md","private":"false"},"hash":"jnJ2q0H0+RgGMqKC2g5AgQ0bDI5Re5jRZz3BMHtwSC8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"5af03940-b023-4e12-a71b-4af39179a169","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md","private":"false"},"hash":"ULAja3Rupg4NF3XduKqS8dzSxTSfi7+BJkn3qWQfHzk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"69bdda7d-57c5-4e7d-b1ba-703ec563ec77","metadata":{},"hash":"qjGADdqrkWSNn41vwpmf6tYyH9DgdGjCXbSuRAR5oxg="}},"text":"I believe that's the right type.So timestamp, whenever a row is added to this table, it's going to get the timestamp placed on it and so that we know when that record was actually created.Okay so we then got back to let's have a double check again we've got the name of archer and the description a text okay so again name so this is the name of the course.Name is a reserved word you can use use that word in this context so I could actually just just change it to a course name.That actually might be a better descriptive name of it and it's gonna stop any sort of confusion there.We're gonna know when it's a name and it says course_name that it is of the course table.And we can give it a varchar like so.Okay so we've got the course ID created at course name and the Vacha.I'm gonna have a description.Okay so this is description for our course.Okay I'm gonna use the text type here because I expect this to be more like a paragraph of content.With Vacha it's I guess more for a limited name.Ideally, it's sort of, our child will probably store less bytes in their records.Not that that's such a big issue these days in the past.That is something that people would stress about because, wow, RAM was expensive and so was this space.So thankfully, that has changed from there.And so we can have a image as well and this is going to be a VARCHA and it's going to point to some sort of hosting that we will talk about at a latest point.But for the time being it's just going to be a VARCHA.It could be an actual direct link to where the image is actually located.Okay, all right so that's going to have our ID for the course, the created app, course name, description and the image there.Okay, so we've got one table and that courses table, I mean it's a key part of our LMS.You need to have a course to be able to learn from, So it's really important that we have this table as part of our MVP.So let's continue

let's continue on.I know we need, with anything with a course, you could have maybe a course section.So you've got the course itself but you need the actual content for each part of it.So what we can do now is a table again for the courses section.So courses section.Like that.Okay.And so this courses section is going to need a ID.So we can have a section ID, integer again, primary key, like so.And we can do the most important part about it is that we can have a relationship there for the courses to the courses section.So we can have the course ID as an int.And we're also going to need, I guess, something to go into our courses section.So we'll have-- what we could really have.So a section could be maybe it's some text, it could be just a sort of a free-form text area.So we could have section itself and the content.OK, so say I see like a section would be like a page in the course.So we can give it a title.Title would probably be good.Something like that.Vacher will have the course itself and we'll have a section of where it is and we'll also need probably something they probably haven't thought about is something like an order.So we're going to have the order for the section.So what do I mean by that?So imagine you've got a book and the book would be a course and in that course you'd have the book and it would have in it it would have pages and each page could have like a title, it could have the order so like which page it's on so this could be the order so one to you know 100, 150, 300 whatever how many pages your course is going to be.So by having an order there we can shuffle stuff around if we want want to at a later date, which is going to be handy for people administrating the course.So they're going to need to have some way of being able to order that section.So imagine we've got the courses page.They're going to have a landing page for that course.They go into the course.They go to the first

quickly.This is why we're doing it as a diagram so that we can get it clearly in our head about what we're actually trying to do.So we're going to have the Media ID, the section ID, and we're going to have the Course ID.No, we don't need the Course ID, do we?Why do we not need the Course ID?Because we've already got the Course ID in the section, so if the courses media is linked to the section there, then we should be fine.Okay, so I've got the Media ID, Section ID, and then I'm going to have an image.Okay.And.I'm actually not going to do that.I'm going to do the actual section content.So

so we've got the courses, the courses section, the courses media.also going to need some comments I believe.So what we can do is we can have that again another table and we can have our courses.This is going to be the comments table.Okay, so we've got this courses comments.We need to link, we're going to link the comments to the media, and the media is going to be linked to the section, and the section is going to be linked to the course row.Okay, so we've got the courses comments.So I'm going to have 'comment ID', again, another primary key, like so.And we are going to have the student.So I'm going to put the student ID in.And I'm going to put the comment itself.Okay, so we're going to do a basic structure here now for our courses.We talked about that we want students to be able to enroll into these courses.So we need to also probably have some way of recording how that's done.There's a couple of different ways we can do that.We'll come back to that because I think it's probably important now that we start showing some of these relationships between these four tables so that we get an understanding of how this data is all going to be tied together.And this is the biggest reason why we use the entity relationship diagram.It just makes it easier for us to understand what the relationships are between the different tables there.It's got a really basic sort of structure here.So you've actually got two ways to do this according to the docs here.So you can do your relationship like so with the ref there pointing to the other table.Or you can use for the likes of a many to one relationship.you can do the same of having it in line instead and you can see here it's very similar syntax, it's just that it's got a square brackets around that.Okay so let's grab this one,

wrong way.I'm going to do.So I'm going to have many sections for many Ds.So I'm going to go the other way there.So it better, you can see there when I highlight it, you know, it shows one and the star, star being many, so one to many.So I've got one course ID, it's going to have many sections.So the course ID here, this is not going to be a primary key, there's going to be multiple versions that will be same course ID for all the different sort of pages that we're going to have on our course.Okay so let's have a look at that.So we've got courses, we've got the courses linking from to the section.We now need the.again same sort of thing.So you can drag and drop that and we'll do those lines for you.You could write this up, anyway there's nothing stopping you from doing that kind of beauty of this tool is that you know you've got a GUI for when you want to use it and you've also got a quite nice markup language that's easy to share.Another good thing about this having it be all sort of a markup language that's not specific you can actually this is this is independent of database it is.So in the case of our project we are using Superbase which is basically a hosted Postgres database.So we can make it export this to some Postgres SQL or flavor of Postgres SQL but this dbml language is actually to the database agnostic so we could maybe even export the same thing for the links of MySQL or Microsoft SQL as well I believe.Okay so we've got the courses, I've got the courses section, courses media and we're gonna have the comment ID.What did I

structure there, so we can have you know one section can have many media items in it and of course a media item can have many comments against it.So the students would be able to you know maybe ask questions or they could maybe tag their instructor or just try and get some clarification or maybe put something in a way that they understand it better.So that way of course then the course in question is going to actually be make a lot more sense to a lot more people.Okay so we have the courses, course section, course media and the courses comments.You go a little bit of a little bit of play here, you can choose which colour your actual the theming I guess for the diagram is so we can do the same where we can Have a whole lot of the structure of tables here and that To me I guess the one of the key Tables that we're going to require There's one that's going to have the students information Okay, so students information again Something like that.We are going to need a student ID.Like so.Again, primary key.And we are going to have created it.I missed that on some of our other tables.Probably thinking why do you need to create it on all these tables?The good thing about a database is by having this extra metadata around it, not only do we have the information about what record was being added, knowing when is actually going to be helpful as well.So maybe we have an error log in our application and we could actually then draw back through the created at records there.So we might be able to see if there was an issue there with that table that could give us some

here so we would expect there to be a link there between the student ID and the comment.Ok so they need to, we know then that this table now is linked via IDs here and why have we done it this way?Well the big thing that remember is with databases and the like, we try to make our data so that it can easily be updated or changed.It's common these days for people if they get married or in a civil union etc they may change their last name so it would be annoying if you had to repeat the first name and last name on all the comments so that when that user updates their details, then we'd have to go into multiple records there and I'll take those records if we were storing their first name and last name.But instead of course we're storing the student ID.So we're storing instead the link between this table and the other and that's it.Which means that if we do change, If they need to change their last name or first name or email address, they can do so and they are only going to

some way of tracking, I guess the progress of where our students granularity, we would I want to actually record where the student got up to.I could have it right down to the media itself, but I think that that's probably too low into the details.I'd probably be okay if we just did just track the progress of the student as maybe they got to page two or page three of the course.So the section is where I probably want my granularity at.So each student is going to need a progression.So what we can do for that is we can create a Students progress table, I think I think that's what we'll call it Table students progress Okay, so this is going to record like I said The student the course that they're on and what section that they are up to okay, so Good thing for this is we probably can get away with the one record per student per course and that way we should be fine in that regards to just track that.So we can do, so we've got the student ID, We're going to have the course section ID, so we're going to need what section ID that they're up to.And then after that, we're going to need to have a Hi there in the chat, I just noticed, sorry.And we're going to need to have, of course, the, we know what's last may be modified.I think that would be a good one to have and of course the course ID.I missed that out, that's pretty important.So again, this whole record is going to be made up of these three things.It's going to be the ID, the course ID, those are the two main records there that we're sort of interested in and section ID I guess will actually be their

we're going to have this sort of relationship here between.Move that out of the way, make it a little bit easier, see?Between the student there and their progress.Okay, so I'd see that their section ID would change as they traverse through the course.they go to the next page, we could then record the following section ID and then we could also update the modified at time stamps so that we keep in

of laid out and a sort of visual representation that helps me think about the way that the data is going to be structured and how I can actually build out my database.Is this the VL and end all?Is it finished?No, it's not.I will probably change my ideas at later stages but it's you know at this point we're just trying to get sort of the MVP the most most valuable product I was like the one I like to call it again make that most valuable product and this is a great way to get started putting at your table structure having an individual way you know you've got a record of it both as some SQL and you could also export it as a PDF or SVG etc.\n\nSo you can embed it in your documentation and you've got that sort of structure there that's saved.I'll be able to come back to this.It makes these nice links here that so you can actually even share these in this tool.So you can see here I've got the share and I can share composite protector, can get invite people etc.\n\nwhich is pretty cool.And another thing that it also allows is we do have the history here so we can roll back in time to see and change that.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ZeUMZzNXBtnWK7r5GNMD19jCT67jmvw9sDms/nmEzzQ="},"0232b6f5-822d-4610-86b6-44b7e7a745a4":{"id_":"0232b6f5-822d-4610-86b6-44b7e7a745a4","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md","private":"false"},"hash":"jnJ2q0H0+RgGMqKC2g5AgQ0bDI5Re5jRZz3BMHtwSC8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3da8509d-924b-40dd-a135-ffacd574fb52","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md","private":"false"},"hash":"rOjETEXxf8eVQ3I5pNB5p2XBWTGGURbl8Jk8HZ3X7Rs="}},"text":"We've

that.I'm going to run up the dev on the container and I'll load it in the browser.Okay.Not a lot there at the moment.A homepage and very basic structure.We've got, I guess, the basics of our project

part, in the project itself, we had a router.Okay.And in that router, we had a courses page.Let's see if that's still working actually.This courses.What's the route?Let's see if that works.Okay.So,

Radix UI elements in this project.So we've got a, I guess, a bit of a shortcut there and how we can actually see those.We're also going to have a, I guess, a way to actually manage the users.So we're going to have students sign up, of course, and they're going to have to have some way to do that.So coming in, back to the Kanban board, we can look at it.And a pretty common thing that you probably need is a sign up page.Okay, we need a login page.Okay, what else are we going to need?We're going to sign up, we're going to log in, essentially a forgot password.Thinking about all the sort of permutations of what's actually going to be required there.Sign up page, login page, forgot password, what else are we going to need?Anything else we can think of?Top of my head.I think that should be fine.We could make a new password.I should actually be calling these routes rather than pages.So that we can route the user where they are needed rather than.Okay, so we can edit the title.Yeah, forgot password route.So these are not the components themselves.This is what I'm thinking of in terms of the routing, in terms of the XJS.Because we need a way to get to the components that we're going to be seeing.And we need to be able to actually navigate that, of course, from a URL.And why do we do this?Well, there's a couple of good things.Why we actually set up all these routes and the

we actually set up all these routes and the like.So a good thing about any sort of website, it's a really good idea to think about all the routes in terms of your HTML is something that you can actually pass off to another application.The great thing about links is you can embed them in, say, a message, or you can embed them in an email.When a user clicks on those, the user would be redirected to that part on the website.And it's better than, I guess, having stage controlling all the different routes.Instead, we can use the URL, which is something that stays the same in this, in the actual sort of URL bar in a browser, and take advantage of that to hold our state of where the actual user has navigated to.And that's probably a key thing about websites is that they have this inbuilt state there, this really clever process of the URL.Very simplistic, but really powerful when you think about what you can do with a URL in terms of being able to direct someone to do something.We can look at the URL that we've got here for the GitHub project.And we can see it's got, of course, the domain to get to the site.The users, so it's got the Andrew James 4 there, that's my GitHub username.It's got projects, it's got a number 4, so that's obviously the project number 4 that's been created.And you've even got like a view there, it's got like an identifier of one, and it's actually even got some parameters there.So before we change some of these, we may actually, let's see what happens to our state.We should get some changes.Yeah, so now we don't see the actual issue itself.Once we click on it, we can see the issue, we can see the item ID.If I click on to some of these others, of course the ID changes.So very powerful, I think, a URL.It's probably something we don't think about a lot, but it's really important to think about it in terms of you'd be able to send someone an email to say, hey, you forgot your password.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"oVUL90HO0e9sOBly+cq0aoZk7NAWO7oclmWL12t4duM="},"9faafb17-fd67-472c-830a-7aa959e4165f":{"id_":"9faafb17-fd67-472c-830a-7aa959e4165f","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md","private":"false"},"hash":"2on9OKUvm3ooQskFZF6FRgGdF4BOrnlAwIe+wT/lML0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"2bbb25e2-fcf4-4680-a5ea-4faf86f03634","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md","private":"false"},"hash":"0HuGTAWI48tItY/iGaFTqAlXjz5rcXx3+0vZFfRkRBY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"65cb0004-d94a-4067-8b55-3c2fa124f9e6","metadata":{},"hash":"gKrRQY836vWlA0kQfnhyrfQcIR6PqI9CEYBcaS1mni8="}},"text":"So

actual routes themselves.So there's a little bit of boilerplates we need to do for that in terms of with the Next.js documentation.So previously we had, of course, the page folder, so you have the folder name.So you can have like a signup route folder name.And in that route, you could have the page.js file, which would actually be, I guess, the routing page to it.And then you could, of course, load components after that with the likes of React.Okay, so I've got these routes here, I've got the project.So we should be able to, let's quickly switch to that.Okay, you should be able to see the project itself.Okay, so this is my last sort of changes I did from last night around the ERD diagram.So I've got a link there to dbdiagram.io and the markdown file.And I've got a link to the extensions and a little bit of help here, where this is all located, a link to the playlist, etc.\n\nSo that's still being updated.The project's running at the moment, you can see I've got it running under a dev container for my project.So I've got a docker running and the actual project is running like so.Now let's go to the courses folder.So with this, I've got a page.js.And in here, I've got a basically the courses heading, some way of getting the data and putting that onto the page.So like again, talking about the routes there.So in the case of a sign up or sign out, we were going to have to do all those kind of steps.And we're likely enough to have a login page, I believe already.Okay, so we've got this pre-configured.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"vt4C3P55GfIRBU/8OtzWYO17kVxar6+YpUihyGdtUlk="},"65cb0004-d94a-4067-8b55-3c2fa124f9e6":{"id_":"65cb0004-d94a-4067-8b55-3c2fa124f9e6","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md","private":"false"},"hash":"2on9OKUvm3ooQskFZF6FRgGdF4BOrnlAwIe+wT/lML0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9faafb17-fd67-472c-830a-7aa959e4165f","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md","private":"false"},"hash":"0ga8osFpnR27IMWfr5I/FdXrkQDYScgEhgHvh3AkbRs="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"0428817d-0813-4431-8d0c-37b3d07c9063","metadata":{},"hash":"a8Xz4j4L1MEPrGlb6kSMNgni6HW1FwnI9t/eG1jnFAc="}},"text":"Okay,

got, they've actually got the same page for the login, sign in and sign up, which is actually not a bad place.I'm probably going to want some extra details going by what we had for the students table.So we will need the email.We will need their password, but we will also need the likes of their first name and last name, just to personalize parts of the actual application itself.So we can do that.And so if I tried to sign in now, it's got some basic validation there on the actual code.Sorry, you probably can't see that.So I'll switch to that.My problem is here.Glad you're enjoying it.Of course, you can always catch up on the streams anyway.Okay.So we've got the signup page.You guys can see that.Okay, that's a bit better.Much easier to see now.Okay.Typical.My chat started to not work.That's okay.I might just open that another window.It might be easier.Okay.Really important.Cool.Okay, so we've got the login form.So we should be able to see that, like I said before, sign in, sign up.Basics of what we need.Let's check what the back button does.Cool.That's just going to go back to the history, which is not bad at all.Cool.Okay.So a lot of that is kind of done for us.I'm

up this project.Not easy to find.I'm going to go and actually I'll just have a quick look through my channel.I believe I actually added it onto one of the videos of course.I've created transcripts for all my videos.So let's go back and actually have a look at it.So we had the LMS with this basic design here.I don't believe that we do any.There we go.Wireframes are here.Perfect.Awesome.Okay.So going back to our design, it's very very simplistic.We've got our sign up form and we've already started to actually change, I guess, some of these pages.Sign up here with course overview.It's looking cool.This is a great thing of why you document things.I could just quickly go back to my transcript there and grab that link.That's there.Able for you guys to be able to jump through and have a look

and that header we're going to need a menu.So a nav bar of some sort.And we're also going to need a footer.Okay.So let's actually start making those into some more tickets.Again, so I'm going to make a header component like so.And in that I'm going to have a logo title.Got some quickly be back in a sec.Okay.Now, since you're getting into a very very specific category, you're going to want to start with the same category.You're going to want to start with a different category.Now, you're going to want to start with the same category.So, you're going to want to start with the same category.Okay, it's going to have a Nav component.We're also going to need something that's probably pretty common to what most people want in any project is a footer and like so.What else we need?Foot and Nav.Might just rename this one.I'm calling it a header.Awesome.Okay, so we've got a header, footer, foot navigation.Okay, so a lot of it I guess is the planning stages and a good place probably to start is this login page route.What I can do, we're going to need a header anyway.Going back to Excalidraw and our designs here.So, we've got the header following the user all the way through from the links of the homepage, the signup page, login page, course overview, course detail.So, again, this is a component that we're going to use throughout the actual application.So, it's a good place probably to start with that login page because then we can actually then start showing the user to be signed

start off with creating the route, which is fine for the login, that, but I think it'll probably even go, even back a step and just go maybe focus on that header component.Okay, I think that's probably a really good place to start, you know, at the top of the page and with that header component, it's going to require to have that logo title component and the header nav component.We'll leave the avatar for the time being, but that way at least we have something to do it.Now I've done something that I probably shouldn't have done.The idea of a backlog as well is to be able to fill in all the description that you're going to add to the tickets.So, I might just move these back for the time being and we'll start off with just the header component there.Okay, so what is it?We want to give it a decent description here.Okay, let's see if we can get a little edit.Okay, we've got some markdown.Okay, a React header component contains header components like logo and navigation.We'll show on

authentication, data storage, roles and permissions were mapped out.Superbase was selected to provide authentication via LinkedIn/Google login as well as for it being a Postgres database.Next.js was chosen for its React framework and Radix UI was selected for accessible, customizable UI components to speed up development.ogimage: \"full-stack1.jpg\"\n---\n\n{% figure \"./full-stack1.jpg\",

has been lightly edited for length and clarity.In this stream I went over the planning stages of a project.First on a virtual whiteboard.I started with a brainstorm of ideas, then moved onto wireframes.Then circled back to start thinking about what features and functionality I would need to build the app.I also talked about the pros and cons of building a UI library from scratch or using something that is already pre-tested and available.Finally I went over the data structure and how I would store the data.To view the Wireframes I created in the stream, please see the following

\"The Whiteboard from the Stream\" %}\n\n---\n\nAll right.Alright, we are live, sorry for the delay.Can you even hear me?There's a few people watching on the stream.Okay.Alright, so what am I doing today?I am going to build a full stack app with Next.js.So I had a few ideas for projects, but something I guess that is kind of floating my boat is trying to build an LMS.And an LMS, a learning management system, can have things like videos, code tutorials, documents.There's a whole range of things.And what the cool thing about it is there are parts of the app that will need to be public, and there will be parts that will need to be private.You will also need some sort of login, and there will be some need for an admin of some sort as well.So it's quite a big wide ranging project, and I know I'm not going to be able to do it all in one hour.So it's going to be a constant stream of every couple of days I will try and chip away a little bit more in it.So it should be quite fun.And yeah, it should be exciting as well in terms of hopefully some of you may have used Next.js before, but this is version 13, I believe.A few things have changed since I've last used it.So I'll be learning a little bit as well as you guys.So that's all good.Cool.Okay.So before we even get started, I guess what am I going to do in terms of the actual planning stage I guess?That's probably one of the first steps.I'm going to jump to my screen.There you go.So sometimes best to when you're starting to think of ideas and how you're going to do something, it's best to sort of whiteboard it.This is about as close as I can get to a whiteboard on a stream.This is freeform.So let's chuck in, I guess, the title.What are we going to call it?Going to be a LMS on Next.JS.Let me know in the chat if anything is hard to read as well.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"YlvSgD6GInjBexKm61tXiDZ/7N1c2l1ZERTk3dASJ0M="},"bb69fcca-7323-490f-a3eb-720ebb204015":{"id_":"bb69fcca-7323-490f-a3eb-720ebb204015","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","private":"false"},"hash":"nA932ceikxqVCY7wwWNnA8IuLLo0k7/NuwR6fFCqr0E="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"e1bc09e9-df4a-400c-ba3d-e1cb31a695d6","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","private":"false"},"hash":"bMnMUuIdV5ujJzpgFuARLoKW/fshgBZIIfy/qL3dI8E="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"1803f788-89e1-482d-9bfa-6e2d985bb845","metadata":{},"hash":"b7Kow0Ygpn4066E0m1me3yya1XYW8/yJ3035CeHhifE="}},"text":"JS.Let me know in the chat if anything is hard to read as well.Because I want everyone to be able to see it.Cool.Okay, so a couple of things that we're going to need for an LMS.We're of course going to need the project so that's a given.But we're actually going to need like a couple of things in terms of planning and that sort of things.So let's put some of those together.We could have, I notice a circle here.Okay.Bring it to the front.Okay and we're going to need probably some wireframes.That's probably a good place to start.We're going to need some way of storing the actual data that's going to be part of the LMS.So let's do that.So we want to determine how we store data.Okay, um big thing, colour theme, really important.We'll need that, colour theme.Okay.I guess Sort of be like I talked about before there will need to be some parts of it that are sort of sitting in the public and that can be indexed by Google and so we'll need public pages.This is just my big sort of my map of kind of how I'm gonna build it all.What else do we need we're gonna have logged in pages.Okay As soon as we say that we need to be logged in in some way We then we need to actually you know think about it in terms of what are we gonna use for authentication?What's it gonna be?What's the scope that can be made up of?Do we build?Do we use something that's off the shelf?It's tricky.Okay.What else do we need?Anyone else?So many ideas.The chat.Do you think the communication we've got that some sort of data store?We might need some sort of how the videos are managed.So media.How will that be handled?I guess what else do I want to have in it?What would be another good thing?I guess with a lot of LMSs you're going to need some authentication.You might need different types of permissions.So we're going to need some way to manage roles.So I could see there could be different types of users.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Ca78C1wW96hVLiT/xeCcCJ925Yidlwk8Hzjs7HIeB7Y="},"1803f788-89e1-482d-9bfa-6e2d985bb845":{"id_":"1803f788-89e1-482d-9bfa-6e2d985bb845","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","private":"false"},"hash":"nA932ceikxqVCY7wwWNnA8IuLLo0k7/NuwR6fFCqr0E="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bb69fcca-7323-490f-a3eb-720ebb204015","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","private":"false"},"hash":"lyotDjpCqY3qSv0iCkZCXjTQeB/rifwHUragg7FtJnc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"b3089352-66e9-4cd8-a241-6a27f76c6303","metadata":{},"hash":"06B45iSD/qO3FEBJrGuKnUMofPUX2fIpp4WQH8UopuA="}},"text":"So I could see there could be different types of users.So you could be someone-- maybe a student could be one type of role, and another role could be an admin or a course content editor that could be in different roles we'd need.Let's do that.So what am I going to do for student?I might just call it content editor.Make it very generic.What else could we have?We've got public pages.We've got logged in pages.We've got authentication.We've got our roles.Students, content editor, it's a way to have some data stored, how we're gonna handle media.A tutor for marking, yeah there could be another role with that a great one.What would that be?What would be a good name?So it could be just Marker, I guess.We'll keep it generic.We can always change these later, of course.Okay.What How sort of people like to see in LMS?How would the students maybe question something or how could they raise any issues?Any ideas?No.I'm thinking maybe they could have comments, so they could actually like comment on the video to make it, I guess, a bit more interactive there with people that are administrating the course.Plenty of LMSs of use in the past that they have some sort of comment system they could have a forum page.Oh, we're starting to get feature group ready aren't we?That's all good.Well I think that the tricky part is in anything when you're doing this is the scoping is you know basically fine tuning it down to what are things that you need to get started and we'll go after that.But I think pretty much a comments thing would be easy to, well a basic comment because this I've got to be careful with it.Non-threaded comments would probably be fine, maybe on each sort of page that could work.What else?I've got Marker, I've got a Content Interact of Student, Communication.Cool thing about authentication is it could be done in a couple of ways.So in my head I'm thinking you could have just a traditional sort of email password, which is fine, absolutely, some people love it.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"5qhSw/7PuYMbT+fNI/JM07KJGOnxNX3o6HO9iMBSGBg="},"b3089352-66e9-4cd8-a241-6a27f76c6303":{"id_":"b3089352-66e9-4cd8-a241-6a27f76c6303","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","private":"false"},"hash":"nA932ceikxqVCY7wwWNnA8IuLLo0k7/NuwR6fFCqr0E="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1803f788-89e1-482d-9bfa-6e2d985bb845","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","private":"false"},"hash":"b7Kow0Ygpn4066E0m1me3yya1XYW8/yJ3035CeHhifE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c1a6358c-6052-4c08-ad25-b577807a31f6","metadata":{},"hash":"A3bKenaXOZG5o3+P5VFua+O8f4JitTj3BlFEjHjTao8="}},"text":"But

or something like that when they've finished a course or something like that.But yeah that's something to think about in the future.Yeah so we can have these.I think this is like probably the minimum I think that I'd like to launch with.Yeah, it's looking pretty cool.Okay.I guess the tricky one I've kind of left off.Come to it later I think after the wireframes.This choosing maybe you know build a UI library from scratch or use something that's already pre-tested and available already.It's those cons and pros of trying to do all this stuff.Cool okay I'm just start now so now I've got sort of some brainstorming I guess of what I plan to do save it for starters I'll rename it, there we go RMS brainstorm cool Sorry there.Wireframes.I think that's where I'm gonna start.going to help get that visual sort of idea of what I want to do for my design there.I'm going to keep it pretty simple.I'm going to use something else.I could use this but I think I'll jump to Excalidraw just because it's nice and simple.I always forget how you create a new one.Reset the canvas, that's one.Cool.Alright, okay cool.So well, for starters this is going to be a responsive web app.So I'm going to build it with a mind that I'm going to have sort of mobile sized screens and tablets and of course desktops.Make that look a bit narrower.Let's do that for a tablet.And of course the desktop.Cool.Any design I'm going to need to have, I guess, some sort of header or some sort of notification that the users can be able to navigate around.So I'm just going to put something like this

beside this this is gonna be it's gonna be the home.That's the kind of landing page that's gonna be a page that I want people to come to and be able to know sort of what they're coming to a site about, what's it going to try and get them to sign up, get them to see what's on offer and be able to do a course.So what I could do is I'd have some sort of maybe hero image here which would then entice people to want to be able to take a look.So I'm just going to do like a common thing is images is of course to have a cross-line for it to denote an image and have some sort of call to action, maybe call to action button or something like that that's going to get people to sign up Just keep it really rough.Ok, so that's on a mobile screen, front and centre, right in that first section as they come to the app they're going to see what's on offer, hopefully a nice visual image explaining what's on offer, getting them to sign up.I'm going to want to do something similar for the tablet

them.So you want to make it not just viable, you want to make it so that people will actually want to sign up and pay money for it, so that's making it invaluable to them.Okay, so we've got those through there, sign up.I think the other thing I'll probably just put on for now is a footer, and I'll keep it pretty low key again, probably just some links I think in the bottom here.Again, sort of

screen they'd see that but they'd also have course this on the mobile it's just that it's not going to be easily visible I guess above the fold there.So we still have it, we just have it a bit lower down.Make it a bit more square.So desktop is next and again I can probably use a lot of what I've already got for the some tablet sort of size.I can play around with my ratios a bit more.I've got a bit more room to breathe.Potential here to have a nice hero image.What are the benefits, features or something like that.Could be as an image or it could be as text.Not quite sure yet.Cool.Okay.Sign up.That's done.Of course when you have a sign up you're also going to need some sort of login.I want to have this, the reason I've just not haven't done a lot on the sign up process is I don't want actually too much of a barrier there to get them first in the door.Ideally as being a, I guess, a potential student user, try to collect the minimum amount of information as possible.So maybe email, password, I can take them to a profile page later and they can fill in those kind of details.So I'll just try and keep it super simple and the other cool thing about this is if I have it very simple like this I can actually reuse it.I can use this for my login as well.Sometimes we want to take some shortcuts.Again this is a MVP but I'm trying to build.It's not gonna be all singing and dancing yet but it's really good to try So try and be mindful of how you can sort of do things and not take too much time.Okay so let's do that.Sign up.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"VAjYQsmxpy8KV0B5DqntCwzEqlw/4clcdTL+JiAJTEM="},"2edb83f2-e5ab-4318-bfa8-4430c598553c":{"id_":"2edb83f2-e5ab-4318-bfa8-4430c598553c","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","private":"false"},"hash":"nA932ceikxqVCY7wwWNnA8IuLLo0k7/NuwR6fFCqr0E="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ee6ab9fd-1b46-4f68-82ec-e0212dc0ef64","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","private":"false"},"hash":"XCWhtBH3CIb7z5n9XUOJe7c3PuVZEJ0vLME4SbXWPpc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"ced7be73-e1ee-4077-8fce-84d2a8ebad94","metadata":{},"hash":"fZBir/0M265nXAvloytAJ+mzNqKJFZzcgZ8d2BcFvns="}},"text":"Okay

questionnaire.maybe some things to think about in the future.But if we want to think about this in terms of, I guess, any VP side of things, probably the most common thing with an LMS would be my text, and maybe a video.Having those two, I think, would be a good starting point.So let's have one of these labels.Sorry, what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do what I call it.Namely things is hard, really

like something.I'll recognise when I come back to it and go, what was that that I was trying to draw?There you go.And maybe another black text box underneath that.And of course we talked about it

the tablet.Um.And then again, for the desktop, I don't know if I'll do it that much different too.Instead I'd probably just make use of the area to actually have a bigger area for viewing the video.So let's do that.This one needs to be in print.I'll just use my crew drawing.The number one thing with a wireframe is that you want it to be relatively quick to put together, and the second thing is that you want it to at least be recognisable so that when you show it to someone else they would actually hopefully understand what you're trying to do.Okay, cool.Cool.Okay, so I've got a course

could we have initially?What I'm going to do is I'm just going to circle what I think I can actually, I guess, can get away with as doing for my MVP.I'll just use that tool.It's a bit big.So I could get away with having just the role for a student potentially.What else could I get away with?I could potentially just have email password as your authentication and then add the single sign on

Docker image running Postgres and I could use potentially something like Octa for sort of authentication there.Octa or Off Zero, having its little baby brother.Alternatively, there's one thing that's coming to my mind that could do both.And actually also hopefully save us some time.How do you know these things?This is the hard part, is basically you don't unless you've been searching out there for this kind of stuff.It's like how would you know what to even search for?But you could just like 4-0 of course.4-0 is basically your identification platform.So it's got the ability there to do all the, just like we want there, email password and continue with either sort of like Google or Office or like I've talked about LinkedIn as well.There's definitely something I could do.And on the database side, I could just use Postgres database.I could use maybe You can see here there's Amazon advertising there on that sponsored link for having a SQL Postgres database that's hosted on Amazon and it's a database as a service.Again, got the actual Postgres site.I know of another thing that would be quite beneficial.And that would be Superbase.So what I try to think about is, Firebase would probably be more similar to something like Mongo and it allows you to have a communication system, data structure and even things like being able to have storage on that side of things.So, media.We can do the

storage so we could store things like videos and images.That probably suits us nicely.Okay, cool.So I think we've made some decisions around that that we could, you know, we've got the ability there to do our authentication.So let's double check to make sure that we're going to be able to do some sort of single sign-on to have LinkedIn.How can I find that out?Good question.Let's go into the documentation.Enterprise, single sign on, social login.Yes, okay so we've got LinkedIn, we've got Google, we've got Microsoft, whereas you're using Slack, which actually, that could be quite a good one too.Awesome.Awesome okay so those that's all great that's social login that's going to be perfect we've got the ability to do logon with email again that's looking perfect for what we need maybe we've got a quick start there for next so we'll probably jump into this soon probably not today And what else do we need?We needed to look at it in terms of database.So I know that for a fact that Superbase actually also has a quite nice editing tool that's all web-based as well.So you can administer your site I guess while you're in that sort of early stages before you have I guess a full-blown actual interface there that people would be able to manage content in.Like I said in the whiteboarding here, let's try and keep it down to the minimum here.We want to try and get this out

so it's got an SQL editor here, it's got a table view editor.So I've technically got a very basic admin that I can use at least to get started to be able to add content, to add videos and sort of get started there, which is pretty cool.And another normal thing that anyone will question of course is price.always a good question to sort of ask.Let's look at pricing here.We've got a zero dollar.Looks like it's social auth providers.So we've got, it's quite generous I think that 500 megs, that should be fine.Probably not so much on the file storage at 1 gig, the video's big, but you can start off there at least and get going.And you can have 50,000 monthly active users.I wish I could have 50,000 monthly active users.It's more than could expect.So that's probably good in terms of getting up and running fast.Next on the list.How's it gonna look?This is a tricky one.I could of course go and make a full custom CSS theme layout that's probably going to be quite slow to get started.It'll take me quite a long time to build our component library and it's actually really hard to beat something that's already pre-configured.So even if you think about Tailwind even, you know, in terms of development speed, it's still going to make you a little bit faster there because you're not sort of starting from scratch completely.But I'll probably take it one step further again while I'll be able to have a lot of freedom in terms of customisation with something like Tailwind.I'll show you what I mean by that.There's actually another article, there's a couple articles about Tailwind on my own website as well.If you want to have a look Tail and what is Tail in CSS?So I've got a brief introduction about what it's all about.Well worth checking out if you would like to see that.Let's check it into the chat.Okay, it's great.I mean like I have used T quite a few times in the past, but it ends up meaning instead of having to write all our CSS out like this, we end up with it.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"fS8rB2B1JBaUNCEg0WuOSNLKrQe/xnIEd7mm2kct788="},"9ae8a03e-2983-4f64-8462-42fc5a0651f5":{"id_":"9ae8a03e-2983-4f64-8462-42fc5a0651f5","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","private":"false"},"hash":"nA932ceikxqVCY7wwWNnA8IuLLo0k7/NuwR6fFCqr0E="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"6dea7f17-3cb8-415b-baec-ee7946e5dc9c","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","private":"false"},"hash":"ui+Ozd06Mq15QJhA8P3cBHn2g9346EHrwW+wYTh5edE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"4515bcab-b129-4e66-8c67-cbefdf705a2c","metadata":{},"hash":"v86GLcmWHxMjnu35ZIg9R1Tz/mm0jc0QQTNsKD793lU="}},"text":"All the CSS classes are already pre-configured and we just apply them to our components and react.Not bad, it's gonna be quite quick but it's still gonna require us to make all the sort of controls, form elements, things like because we're gonna need a login form so we're gonna need some sort of password field, input field.We'll probably need some nice text area of some sort to be able to do a comments for the users to be able to add comments.We're gonna need buttons of some sort, whether that be to enroll in a course or sign up on a form or that kind of thing.Navigation, that's another thing we probably want to have.We build that from scratch.It's not far wrong with doing that.Just time, time is our enemy I guess.When you're building anything from this for yourself, there's only sort of one person, so you can only, you know, you want to sort of maximize your time being able to build things a bit faster.And I could use a whole range of sort of UI libraries.There's MUI which is the material UI which uses React components.There's Chakra, Ant Design.There's just a couple off top my head.There's a version of Bootstrap that's built with React components.But a new one that I've really liked the look of and again the other great thing about it is that it prioritizes accessibility.It's the Radix UI.So why would I want to use something like this?Well you can see just from the sort of layout here if you look at the like playgrounds you know you've got a whole lot of input controls, you've got switches, you've got cards, you've got you know drop down components that kind of thing, nice little icons, what else, okay even like slider controls, not sure how to use that one but yeah there's even like a little play button there, might be something like that of course for our videos.So it's quite a well-designed sort of theme I guess.It's got the ability there to sort of have some customization where you can switch it already from light to dark.It's got the ability for aspect ratios, avatars.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"CP86gTaFyT7W2Se9gf1wem+6Y5gpJK+cL3U6cxtHD30="},"4515bcab-b129-4e66-8c67-cbefdf705a2c":{"id_":"4515bcab-b129-4e66-8c67-cbefdf705a2c","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","private":"false"},"hash":"nA932ceikxqVCY7wwWNnA8IuLLo0k7/NuwR6fFCqr0E="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9ae8a03e-2983-4f64-8462-42fc5a0651f5","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","private":"false"},"hash":"EE/w2h+AlLbSY5vJEgXxg1eN1xNt1zlxGvpWqVY4mUc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"0ea6f53c-f496-40cc-a4f7-79b7b8c12fcc","metadata":{},"hash":"oz6zDVx1qz0hVUwY724YvTnv5qu4Qm5rEV2Xko9cFdE="}},"text":"It's

nice.Umm, cheap boxes.Code even.That's good.A menu.That's pretty slick.So you've got some awesome sort of ability to do a lot of this stuff out of the box without having to build it from scratch.Another cool thing about this Radix library, I believe it's got really good accessibility.So that's another, again, another thing that's going to also speed up time and sort of development.You know, trying to make your website accessible is a really important part of building anything these days.They say that somewhere between 5 and 20% of people have some sort of disability of some sort.And that's pretty big numbers and that can be ranging from everything from cognitive So maybe ADHD could be low sight, so there's a lot of macular deterioration of where people cannot see things that's easily in the centre of their vision.Colour blindness, there's all sorts.And it's really nice to be able to have something that's already got a lot of that done for you.So again, this theme's got icons, it's got quite a large big icon set, it's got colours, you know, you can use these colour schemes, and it's also got, these are primitives as well, so you've also got the ability there to I guess make some custom elements if need which is quite nice.Which is cool.Documentation wise, accessibility there, it's very much on the top level there.Again, I've got accessible labels, keyboard navigation, focus management, it's all built on there, keyboard navigation is there.So that's a great in terms of being able to build this web app.So going back to our whiteboard, we've got I guess a stack.Let's put like a list together of what our stack's going to be.Now I've already chosen the Xjs.Why?I'm familiar with it.It's React and it's very popular.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"IklKIcjYZQDiSTq5jC6lPaCaUG6YZrrsIfMjeN4/GfM="},"0ea6f53c-f496-40cc-a4f7-79b7b8c12fcc":{"id_":"0ea6f53c-f496-40cc-a4f7-79b7b8c12fcc","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","private":"false"},"hash":"nA932ceikxqVCY7wwWNnA8IuLLo0k7/NuwR6fFCqr0E="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4515bcab-b129-4e66-8c67-cbefdf705a2c","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md","private":"false"},"hash":"v86GLcmWHxMjnu35ZIg9R1Tz/mm0jc0QQTNsKD793lU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"e429aef6-2908-4220-bfac-7c35dbc20965","metadata":{},"hash":"DM3R6uc9VVL3j4dDdP0F9SZrgns6BJef7czPtO4snso="}},"text":"Why?I'm familiar with it.It's React and it's very popular.It's got the ability to also do server-side rendering and client-side rendering, which is going to be of course important for things like public pages where they need to be indexed by something like Google.So next JS, we're going to have a Radix for our UI.We're gonna use Superbase and that's gonna be OOF and that's gonna be DV.Okay, hosting we'll worry about later.I guess the one other cool thing is the videos.It's storage media.We'll put Superbase down for the time being.I'm not sure if it's going to be cost effective in that area but we can sort that out.But there you've got a full stack app that will be built with Thanks.js, so we'll be able to build APIs or interfacing with Superbase anyway.We'll be able to render things server-side and client-side.The key thing about the client-side side of things is that we want to be able to track things like people's progress and eventually have some sort of interaction or some core sort whether that be you know questionnaires surveys that kind of thing so again it's leaning towards a a view library like React or Angular or View so that's kind of where we're looking at in terms of stack and again next why I'm using that is because it is it's react based and I'm comfortable with react sometimes it's good to work with something you know see what's up rendering Okay, awesome.Okay, so I think that's, we're at 230 now.I'm gonna stop I think for now.But from, I guess from the next, our next session, we will jump into more of us planning, getting this tech stack set up.set up and of course starting to do something like a cam bam board or some sort where we can actually break up sort of all the work that needs to be done.So thank you everyone that's been watching my

(Learning Management System) using the Storybook.js, Superbase, and Radix UI.So far, I have set up a header component and am working on building other components in isolation using the storybook.The LMS project is in its early stages with a homepage set up and another page for listing data.The Superbase database is connected, with a few tables for courses and students.The next step is to work with Radix components.The project is available on GitHub as LMS NextJS.Check out the documentation on Radix UI components for more information.youtube.com/embed/EXvU7F1D59o?si=8kM1Zl-k5_MIjtDG\n\n---\n\nAll right, hi there.I'm back.It's been a while, I know.So I'm going to be back continuing this project with our LMS using the storybook.js, Superbase, and Radix UI.So just to recap of where we got to, we have a component here.Okay, so we got our header component.Basically, that's all we've got set up at the moment in our

that's all we've got set up at the moment in our project.We're trying to build our components in isolation using the storybook.And in storybook, we will flesh out all our components that we can use, but in that sort of the layout, the stuff that's going to be reused as much as possible.So that includes things like the buttons, the header, photo, et cetera, that kind of stuff.Nothing that's real, I guess, layout specific.Okay, so what have we done so far with the LMS?Not a lot.We've got a homepage.I think we've got one other page where we're listing out some data.We've got Superbase connected up to it.We've got a couple of tables.We've got courses.We've got students and some supplementary tables around those too.Okay, so if you haven't been keeping up, might pay to have a look at the project.I'm just going to paste that into the chat.Okay, so that should come up shortly.And if not, it should be part of the description as well.What I'm going to do next is try and get some of these Radix components, wrap them in our own layers so that we can manipulate them how we would like to use them, and try and get those set up and ready.So let's jump into Chrome and I can show you that.Okay, so that's the project there.We've got the LMS, just the actual dev environment there, localhost 3000.So not much to see there.We've got some next one component that I'm going to make.I'm going to make a button and I'm going to give it the options to have a icon as well.So I'll set that up shortly.We've got our wireframes.So we've got our homepage there, sign up, course overview, course detail.Okay, so that's all we've got so far.We've got a storybook and we've got Superbase.Cool, okay.Let's get started.We'll start off with this button.Easy way to get started is I'm literally

the storybook.Okay.That's a little rapid.Yeah.This looks pretty complex.Okay.This is looking like it could be a winner.Okay.We didn't actually check to see if the customer route was actually taking effect.Let's see, it still doesn't look like it's working.We've got a default view there.Look at the storybook class.We've got a storybook route.That is our button.Okay, so it is updating.Okay.Let's try this as well.Okay.Is there a body?Review.What is that?ReviewBody.js.Review.And it's just kind of pull off.It's like.We've got the radio there, we've got the matches, we've got the controls.Let me try something like Add a preview here.And let's just go something pretty crazy out there.Completely.Let me stop that.Something like that more.Is where I'm going wrong.It should be.That's frustrating.When you read the docs, read the docs.Back to Chrome here.We've got HTML.Still no joy.I'm just going to start and stop it.Refresh.Hey, we've got a customer out.We haven't got our stuff appearing there inside it.We've got some way that we can wrap it around.It's not going to be much fun though because it's.It's just going to embed it as HTML.Back

could add some HTML around it but that's actually not really going to help us.We want to be able to add the JavaScript theme component just like we do for the standard page and I'd like to do it at the top level rather than have to do it further down the chain in each storybook but it's looking like that's not going to be an easy thing to do.So what can we do instead?Now we can't have with this default here any parameters around it but let's have a look.So this is the default in the story that's just the arguments.Ah!Args can modify any aspect of your component.You can use Args in your stories to configure the component's appearance similar to what you do in an application.For example here's how you could use a photo argument to populate a child component.This is going to import the page, have it as a child.Okay this could actually be what we want.The only downside is this is at that story level.So we do have that render function.Some components require a harnessed render and a use away.For instance if a component runs right up to its edges you might want to space it inside Storybook.Use a decorator to add spacing for all stories of the component.Okay so with that example.Apply story.Story to enable it.I'll take some locking.Okay so this is on preview.js.Back to where we started.Theme provided there, theme default.This is actually looking more like what we want.Let's try this again.Being a developer is probably 90% reading the documents.Especially if you're using open source projects.Just to be able to implement it in your own project.Okay so this is my

it looks like we're all live.Hello everyone.So again, this is the second part in the Builder Fill Stack Next.js app.Last week on Thursday, we did a planning session.And so I went through how I was going to plan the app, go through things like a wire framing.So we have a link for that here.And we've also got the mind map, which was here.Okay, so we've got the brainstorm here.It was what we went over on Thursday.And we also have the actual, not the code yet.That's what we haven't

first article on the list at the moment.It's built with fullstack and NextJS, part one planning.So if you look at that, there is the link to the video, link to the wireframes, screenshot of the whiteboarding and there's a whole transcript there of the entire video.So if you want to quickly find something you can do so.Awesome!Okay, all right what are we going to do today?Today we are going to start setting up the initial parts of the app.Okay so I'm going to go through that whole process of installing the actual code on a local machine, setting it up in a GitHub repo, pushing that to public so that you guys can see it.And then I'm also going to try and start the part of actually building the app, start looking at the wireframe there and start getting that working.Okay cool okay so if we go to the docs for Next.js\n\nso on the Next.js org website forward slash docs there is a usually what's for pretty much every single website you can imagine these are getting started page and getting started page is generally what we want to look at in in terms of actually installing all the prerequisites there and actually get it up and running.So first of all, number one, you're going to need Node.js 16.14 or later and pretty wide range here.You've got macOS, Windows or Linux.Okay, I'm going to open up a terminal window.Let me see.OK.So in my developer directory I'm going to go into YouTube.Cool.OK, so I'm going to create a new project here.Again, we need to look at that MPX command.So let's grab that.Come back to terminal here and this is going to install the latest version of create next.So what is your project named?We're going to call it LMS next.js.OK, we're not going to use TypeScript.I'll do that another

going to set up the over code needed there for React, React-DOM, Next, DSLint, and Excellent Config Next.Funnily enough it says those things in the Installing Dependencies part there.So, okay, cool.Let's have a look at this directory now.If we go into the LMS folder, okay, cool.Think about it, it's already set up a Git repo folder there.I'm going to open up this folder now.So open full stop or period depending on where you live.So open there is going to open up the finder.Cool so we can see the actual files themselves.Cool and we can do code.fullstop and that is going to open up a nice vision of VS Code already pointing at that directory.Cool.Okay so I've got that up and running.You should be able to see that on the screen.What I'm going to do next is start talking about what other dependencies we needed.So going back to the whiteboard here.So I talked about the need to have Radix UI.So I was going to use that for my UI components.way I'm not building them from scratch sort of thing.Instead I can actually just worry about the other parts of the app rather than the actual UI components because I know that these components have been tested, they've got really good accessibility.Instead I can just focus on I guess the back end parts of the app and not have to worry too much about the front end.The other part that I'm going to need is of course Superbase and so we'll set that up as well.Okay so let's go to the Radix UI website.Okay again it's a nice big getting started button let's use that.Again, I'm going to copy that and I am going to open up the terminal window here.Okay.So while that's installing, let's go back and have a look at the getting started guide here.After that, I need to import the global CSS file at the root of your application.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"kQ45noIliLNRcU8J3Pe3cCmJguRsAt412IAjX268Vcg="},"55cc1231-d4c0-45ec-a3f6-e0eddce14155":{"id_":"55cc1231-d4c0-45ec-a3f6-e0eddce14155","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up.md","private":"false"},"hash":"RhxmpoW/KSRddokdku4FCoO4/1QiRZkvxX2zMu5Fngs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"73361ef0-62cf-4c0a-a260-4163d9082231","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up.md","private":"false"},"hash":"17lRJVf+i3iGPNXCPiPAA0wJsCDqaaVZd6G3qhQ30U0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"581c9d9f-c8ec-4f84-8fb9-914f5454a537","metadata":{},"hash":"8w5zOMsAGFvj0Ihn3+AZfdRaQWoOIH0UBNQ1yvenx4g="}},"text":"After that, I need to import the global CSS file at the root of your application.Then I need to add the theme component and add theme to your application, wrapping the root component inside of body.OK, cool, grab that.OK, so that's installed.And it'll go into the source directory.And in here, we actually have the actual layer of the app.Okay, let's have a quick look at this, get our head around what's actually happening.So first up we have a page.It's a home component and we also have an image being pulled into it.So this is the actual content of that page and the layout would be the core part of the app is being built.You can see there that we have the HTML tags and of course the body there.So what I'm going to do is I'm going to import the style sheet.And then after that I am going to then go back to the docs help file and I'm going to do the import process here.So I'm going to import the theme.Okay, and then I'm going to wrap my app just like it has shown here in a theme component.And I can move it like so.Okay, cool.Body theme.Okay, I might actually do the same as what they have done.Probably pays to pay attention to what the instructions are doing.Okay and I've got an extra tag there.Cool.All right.Okay so we have the theme going now.If we actually run the application, let's see what happens.That's localhost 3000.Okay, so we're not seeing any sort of UI changes or anything like that.We've probably still got the initial stylings there from Next.js.Let's go with the Alumnares.Okay.Cool, so the title's changed so we know that something's happening and that's tab and we can start pulling apart I guess what's already in there.I'm just going to rip it all out to this global style sheet and probably not going to use that.Again it's starting to look very sparse and And if I do the same here, I'm going to have to be mindful of the fact that there's expecting those styles that are coming from that CSS module.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"MMeBqyT4X/Q/ajSXnkBBocpLgto336dLKZ2TBi9X/KA="},"581c9d9f-c8ec-4f84-8fb9-914f5454a537":{"id_":"581c9d9f-c8ec-4f84-8fb9-914f5454a537","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up.md","private":"false"},"hash":"RhxmpoW/KSRddokdku4FCoO4/1QiRZkvxX2zMu5Fngs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"55cc1231-d4c0-45ec-a3f6-e0eddce14155","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up.md","private":"false"},"hash":"9ncZBGiU17e1EiOH1nFk7vFDwlij9V/uYX8xp+Yv6ds="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"756778cf-4482-43bf-9354-368946234efb","metadata":{},"hash":"rWF85fyjYEnEcoP2IaogvaiUEmwIPLyoeQjbvl3D83k="}},"text":"So I'm just going to pull that all out.Why not?Let's make it home.Cool.stripped out, all completely pulled apart but we know that let's just double check that our CSS files that are coming in.We can see here we've got a whole lot of CSS variables.So these are the ones that are coming in from the likes of RadixUI.We've got whole different color suites here, all available to us.Awesome.All right, can we see that they have like a.It's just telling us where the CSS is coming from.Got some default values here.All right, and then we've got radix themes.Okay, we are on the way to getting there.Okay, all right.Next steps, you're now ready to use Radix themes components.Cool.I will probably stop there and a good place to stop probably is now into a commit of my source code.and it should commit added vertex UI.So if you've got the GitHub extension here, you can actually also do the same as this and publish it live.Awesome, so if I open this now, I should be able to see that in Chrome.There we go and it's public so you guys should be able to see that as well.Awesome.Okay next steps.Like I said we talked about we needed Next.js setup, we needed Radix UI setup.The next probably part what we need is start talking thinking about our database.Okay it's pretty early on I know but it's good to get this up and running so we can actually start sort of planning out more of our app.Okay so let's find the Superbase website.Cool, so I've already previously signed on with GitHub before, and I need to now create a new project.OK, I'll call it LMS.and copy that password and place that somewhere where I'm not gonna lose it okay All right, OK, my password is saved now.Region.Not the closest to me.I might do Oceania Sydney there because that is closest to me.OK, I'm going to create

Next.js and they do actually have a Next.js section which is a framework quick start.Very handy.So we've created that new project.After it's done we should be able to see a table.Okay now we're not going to make a country's table.We're going to go and start off maybe with our.probably course, I think it might be a good one to start with.And then we will then have to add this super base off there.Okay so we can use either like this command line here where we can add the template and have a look at that to grab each piece we need.Or we can just actually manually add it into our project.So if we take a look at this, I can actually copy this, I'm going to create this on the terminal.This doesn't seem to be a link directly to the actual project there, unfortunately.Not a problem.We'll sort that out, that's it.Okay and hopefully, yes our database is all set up and running now.Okay so we've got the database there so if we click on the table editor, you can see we've got learning new tables and we need to actually go and set it up with the likes of Superbase.Now does this actually have a nice walkthrough for.Just adding it to an existing project, that's what I want to do.Okay so here's an example here, so we need to install the Superbase.js file here.I'm going to double check this so that it matches what's the expected VF for next.js.I'm going to copy that and I'm going to

going to open a never version of code.we're going to have to take a look at it.The key part here is we can see that what's has been added to it.You can see those dependencies.So the great thing about any sort of node's JSP package, so whether it be using YARN or PNPM or NPM like we're using here, you can see what actual packages have been installed.So dependencies of course are the the ones that we use in our actual app and dev dependencies are the ones we use when we are working on our project in a dev environment.Okay so I need both superbase of the auth and I'm going to need the superbase of the JS there.Okay so all of us is breaking, let's go and do that again.Okay so, control A, npm install.There we go.Okay so that's a bit of update from our package.Nice enough.We've got the auth helpers there and we can do the npm install.Let's grab the other one.from here.Alright so now that's running, we've got the superbase js file there, we've got the auth helper for nextjs.What we've got

that and place that into our project as well.Because we're going to need something like this but we are going to drop the example part from there.Now big thing to look out for, it's a little bit

this later and we'll never look at it again.So what I'll do is I'll grab my keys that I need for that and then I'll be able to see what's happening there.Okay, right.[pause] [laughs] Okay.So we've got the Superbase parts pasted into our app.We've got them sitting in the package there.So we'll have those node modules now installed.Okay.So what's next?Let's look at what has actually been done.Okay, so great thing it's already been set up for us.We actually have some components there so we can take these and the same with that super base

what's already there.We're going to have a little bit of issues, and the key thing there that will be a bit of a pain will be the fact that this is in TypeScript, and we're not using TypeScript, so we will have some renaming today.Okay, I'm going to go and set up the same folder structure basically.I've got source app and I'm going to have a source components.Like that.Okay, and we are going to need We already have an app folder, a super based folder.Okay, I actually don't want any of this to do some stuff, so this is actually not a bad thing anyway to not have this already pre-configured.I'm just gonna leave that out, not have any migrations there.We'll do that later and what I do want to do, let's look at these components here.We'll start off with the logout button.I'm not too worried about the other two.Okay so this one is a JavaScript file.And looking at this we can see, you know, it's relatively basic here, I can see it's using Tailwind but we're not using that.Very export, default, I call it Lockout button, good to have the same name there and we're going to return just keep it as simple as that if we want to.I probably might be using one of these buttons but that's okay we will grab that form and we'll put that button inside it.Now one thing that's going to be slightly different of course is that we are using the Radix UI so there'll be a button component already available for that, but I will change that shortly.Okay so I've got my logo button, what next do we need to add to our app?So again they've got the layouts, they've got very simple page.Okay so they are setting up a server base and they're getting a user.Okay so basically doing a check there to see if they are logged in.Okay, not a problem.Okay, so that's all good.We'll do that shortly.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"GEPsY2FMN078zZrxdZodkcE3kuMfVOOvX15A5yUxy7c="},"b857c2ce-f0a0-421d-83d3-8dc28e1dbaa8":{"id_":"b857c2ce-f0a0-421d-83d3-8dc28e1dbaa8","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up.md","private":"false"},"hash":"RhxmpoW/KSRddokdku4FCoO4/1QiRZkvxX2zMu5Fngs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ef05cb00-cf61-46bb-b54c-41992ad8b271","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up.md","private":"false"},"hash":"lKwt1SaY6HmIHN6jxevGHPN6h2IoNuzSeXCos1KFka0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"95147251-39fc-4300-943d-7c09fc9a2449","metadata":{},"hash":"BDB1KkkT15Uk2LiyFwkZZk7Hk1wN79wmr0PUDpiKMKg="}},"text":"Okay,

know that's going to complain but it's fine.Copy that.New file, make it our route file, then we can paste it in.So the only thing we're having a issue here with here is this.We don't have this request object.Request type, sorry.Okay, but we can have it like that and pretty much shouldn't complain.Yep, that's the only difference there by having it in TypeScript or not.Okay, so that's all cool.Same again.Okay.So what are we doing?What are we actually doing here?We're actually making all the different app calls here So great thing about Next.js is that it's both a front-end and back-end in WAM So

with the logon except I I am going to strip that out for a sec.So we'll copy that again, paste it, rename it.Okay.Alright, link on the logo there, don't worry about that, probably not.Just keep the

red X1s in a sec.Okay, looking a lot better.Okay so that's not going to be so bloated I guess before Taiwan classes.Okay so that's the login and sign up and sign out.Probably a good point now to check

I need to actually run this in a dev container.Add that configuration file.And we'll just use the default for now.Let's just add it and we should be able to now reopen this in a container.So the reason I'm adding it to Container is the version of Node.I've got it on.I'm trying to use 20.Slightly experimental, all the latest.So the idea being that if I need to change, I can set my different version of node based on this dev container here.I can swap it out for something else.It just means that in sort of future proofing.Okay, so that's running, and we'll run that to super.Localhost

start the project up when it first makes those dev containers and it is going to install all the node modules.So I have that rebuild.Just saving the next person that has to probably open the project or ourselves.Another thing to do basically of installing npm packages.Okay cool, I think I'm going to stop here today.So we've got sort of like the basics there of the project.It's all been configured, It's been set up.We've grabbed a lot of parts from the existing template there for the likes of Next.js with Superbase And we've also set up our Superbase table Until next time we will do actually get the authentication running and We will try and get some data showing on the page coming from our database Hope you all enjoyed that Please like and subscribe if you haven't already That

alright?Just double checking the stream, always pays to.Cool so we're good, we're good to go.Sound is working.Getting a little bit of feedback here on my headset but that's OK, I can put up with that.OK so we've got this header here.We built it last time, it's not much to it.As you can see it's just literally a HTML header component with the H1 inside it there.We didn't place it anywhere inside our app but we can keep going on that.Let's take a look at what we've actually done so far.So we have gone through some planning last week.So let's switch to Chrome, we'll just take a look at that.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"sV3Fnay8EvRsvi1ZM+BtHrEEQKOVUSQO0l1Ipcsuc5U="},"2b33c76c-cf70-46f3-a848-3b033b8f802f":{"id_":"2b33c76c-cf70-46f3-a848-3b033b8f802f","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","private":"false"},"hash":"zEkxOGML2n7dLUPM4YlE+8CxsnimfJHMQbEhv3fITSo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1ef95ed0-0a3c-48f6-a8e6-50ec2af9f882","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","private":"false"},"hash":"sV3Fnay8EvRsvi1ZM+BtHrEEQKOVUSQO0l1Ipcsuc5U="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"13de8423-8b1e-45fb-86af-40b1f738d4ae","metadata":{},"hash":"vcJ/phMsWowSq8rZYbJWIEQFPJkutb2Yl5k8rBDYFQ8="}},"text":"So let's switch to Chrome, we'll just take a look at that.So in Chrome we set up the planning for the Kanban board in GitHub projects.And you can see we have created a backlog of routes and components and items that we need to do.In the in progress column we've got the header component there so that's underway.Now we can do a couple of things to help us in terms of building our React components.One thing I like to do when working on a new project is to actually have a thing called Storybook.Now Storybook is a way for us to have a playground where we can build our components in isolation.We can style them to our sort of heart's content away from the main app and it means that we can sort of configure them, set up easily the different properties for them, even have some dummy data set up so that we can maybe enable, disable, add new titles, content, you name it, that kind of thing.We can do that.I have done a previous, I believe I did a previous video on that before so if you have a look back through my YouTube channel there's some guide sort of thing on how to do that but we'll start again from scratch.We're going to add it to the project.We'll get that going.We will continue on building out our header component and we will continue on trying to start getting this project coming together.Okay, so what do we do when we want to start something?We look at the docs.Let's look for Storybook here.Storybook.js.org.So this is the one.Okay, so that's all new.Looks like they've updated it.That's cool.Okay, so if we go to the Get Started guide, that's always a good place to start.They've got a good channel on how to get it all set up and running but we'll do the same.So they want us to initially install Storybook for the project and make sure that you read this part here.Storybook is not made for empty projects.Storybook needs to be installed.If I work on empty projects, there are many ways to bootstrap in a framework.We have an app already.So I think we should be good.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"0l+6qSsKq86Ev5o1BkwYepHpGW5usME40RHG2tOcWQ0="},"13de8423-8b1e-45fb-86af-40b1f738d4ae":{"id_":"13de8423-8b1e-45fb-86af-40b1f738d4ae","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","private":"false"},"hash":"zEkxOGML2n7dLUPM4YlE+8CxsnimfJHMQbEhv3fITSo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"2b33c76c-cf70-46f3-a848-3b033b8f802f","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","private":"false"},"hash":"idFrqNj2I78ImDULurTzk05D62g2wM3bku4NCYplx6w="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"8a8d2ca2-64cb-4382-91c3-c509a46863e9","metadata":{},"hash":"t52qOqBKC3UFrUAtKgn+ibOCl/nsn6k3nEo6hmsg2XQ="}},"text":"We

doing its thing, we should be able to start planning out what we're going to do with our component here.So I've got that.Let's talk about this folder structure.I've created a separate components folder and it's got the header component in it and the logout button.Okay, we have detected that you're using ESLint storybook provides a plugin that gives the best experience for storybook and helps follow best practices.Would you like to install it?Yes, I would.Okay, so it's going to add that ESLint plugin.Keep doing it.So we've got the components folder.So these components that are going to be used across the site.They're not page components as such.So it's all about working in a structure that you are going to understand.I like to keep mine relatively simple.But of course, things change.You can move stuff around as you build out your project.It's not set in stone.This is code.Remember, this is not granite that we are making our project out of.So we can undo things.Okay, so it's taking a little bit of time there.Not a

well, you just see a set up wizard that will help you start a story of introducing you to the main concepts and features, including how that UI is organized, how to write your first story, and how to test your components responses to various inputs utilizing controls.Okay, nice.Cool.We're going to need to have this command here to start the story of workup.I'm going to copy that and let's go back and check on what code has done.Are we finished yet?No, we've got one more question.You need to install the following packages, npm 10.Okay, let's do that.Okay, so that's kind of open that.Let's grab this.Switch back to Chrome.Cool.Okay, so let's go through a tour.That's going to give us a bit of a guided tour of how it works.Start that.Storybook is built from stories.Storybook stories represent the key states of each of your components.We automatically added four stories for this button component in this example file button dot stories dot JS.To note that it's got these separate files here called stories.So we can have our variations there.Story previews are interactive.So when you modify code or story, storybook automatically updates how it previews your components.And this is the key core beauty of storybook here.You are going to be able to see your components in isolation without any impact from the actual UI itself.Maybe other things could impact what your look and feel looks like.So the way that you make your components with storybook is that you then hopefully make them all just independent of each other.And that's the whole goal of building components because we want to be able to reuse them.So storybook previews are interactive.And you'll see here it's got this cool playground here where we have the controls and we can set values.We can change this value here to false.Hey, confetti.Nice.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"eE3+4rdNucdmnvePXjXTH2iHBzNF8bleEQn1tfruBbY="},"b062e977-014a-479b-9b5d-f07126ac9144":{"id_":"b062e977-014a-479b-9b5d-f07126ac9144","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","private":"false"},"hash":"zEkxOGML2n7dLUPM4YlE+8CxsnimfJHMQbEhv3fITSo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8a8d2ca2-64cb-4382-91c3-c509a46863e9","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","private":"false"},"hash":"t52qOqBKC3UFrUAtKgn+ibOCl/nsn6k3nEo6hmsg2XQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"ddf8914f-b62e-4e9e-ae24-b76dff9cb248","metadata":{},"hash":"NbVt/EjYY223q994mdM0eXHYxU++tqYgUtSGmRBsSFU="}},"text":"We can change this value here to false.Hey, confetti.Nice.So with that, we can change that state from being primary to not being primary.So it's just got a false there.So that means that we can very quickly have just by properties alone, we can change a button to be of the primary type.So what would that be?That it could be maybe like on A form.Maybe you've got a save and a cancel.You probably make the primary button the save because that's the interaction you're trying to ask the user to do.And then the cancel would be the non-primary look.So less sort of eye-catching there.Okay.So now it's got this little wizard here on how to write a story.So these imports, first import meter and story object for type safety and autocompletion and typescript stories.We're not using the likes of typescripts.So we want to use it in this case.Next import a component, in this case, the button component.And then the default export, it contains metadata about this component stories.The title field optional controls where stories appear in the sidebar.Okay.So you got that button, you got a title.So this is what you can name it for your example here.So each named export is a story.So its content specifies how the story is rendered in addition to other configuration options.So you can have the, like in this case, the button component.The button component has these variations, one being a primary.It's in a secondary, large and small.I can see there on the left.So we follow through this.We can see all these arguments here.So in this story file, we can set up each of these stories and each have its own object.And each object has its own arguments.Okay.So these are all stuff that you set.These are the properties for the components themselves.So I would imagine this button component has got the properties of primary, label and background.Okay.So those are properties for that component.So if you cast your mind back to where your views react, maybe in the past.So properties are things that you pass into your react components.We'll go over that shortly.Okay.So we'll continue with that.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"MzDuI320IkkM4q38v2eWbld7jfQ2T4nwlztGrJhL2j4="},"ddf8914f-b62e-4e9e-ae24-b76dff9cb248":{"id_":"ddf8914f-b62e-4e9e-ae24-b76dff9cb248","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","private":"false"},"hash":"zEkxOGML2n7dLUPM4YlE+8CxsnimfJHMQbEhv3fITSo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b062e977-014a-479b-9b5d-f07126ac9144","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","private":"false"},"hash":"2IFyauBXGuUyT8E+qddF/sM9wL/fhLUY9C3KivzQ16U="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"210ded1a-5f14-4494-b288-c948b94dddea","metadata":{},"hash":"IueicBB4hxUutgiztbS/vEMDdW8DOsFrIYfnBKNyHig="}},"text":"We'll

have a look at back to our project now.We should see a few different things here.Let's switch back to code.All right.So in our VS code, we can see the little green there.A little bit difficult to see.Maybe it needs to bump up in size.But you can see here, there is now a folder called stories.So we've got stories.It's the same level as our components folder.And in that stories, we have a few files that it's created for us.Okay.So we've got a button, funnily enough, a header, an ASM CSS, etc.\n\nAnd even a storage for that header.So let's just take a look at it.It's probably a little bit more complex than our one.That's fine.And that's okay.We can leave it like that.And in there, we can have our component.We've got the CSS there.And I've got the, looks like some MDX there.Okay.So it's made that folder for us.It's set up the configuration.We should see in our package.json.If we look at our source control here, we should be able to see the difference between it.And we can see there.So what has it done?What has it added to our project?It's added the storybook there.So it's got the port number running there, running the build, and then inside those dev dependencies, because these are for running locally, of course.So it's when they're in the dev dependencies folder structure.So we've got the storybook add-on essentials and add-on interactions, add-on links, add-on bombarding.So all these are parts of the sort of the tutorial.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"YTEXd8zWgJOh+il8QjFufeO2o6NWSvYDT8e7cf0qN7E="},"210ded1a-5f14-4494-b288-c948b94dddea":{"id_":"210ded1a-5f14-4494-b288-c948b94dddea","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","private":"false"},"hash":"zEkxOGML2n7dLUPM4YlE+8CxsnimfJHMQbEhv3fITSo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ddf8914f-b62e-4e9e-ae24-b76dff9cb248","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","private":"false"},"hash":"NbVt/EjYY223q994mdM0eXHYxU++tqYgUtSGmRBsSFU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"194d437e-22d7-49b3-8595-4a98fec90983","metadata":{},"hash":"ibOGa73B9EmwnA2Yr9kheJZoJ/uEUjHyZ7HqaztAfHY="}},"text":"So all these are parts of the sort of the tutorial.And with React and testing library to go along with it with storybook itself.Okay.Cool.Okay.I'm 100% happy with that so far.If we close it.Now the one thing I'm not kind of happy about is we've got our nice sort of component structure.And this comes down to personal preference.This is not set in stone or anything.The one downside, I guess, storybook is that by initially it will store all these files.We can remove those.That's not a big problem.So let's actually go through and look at that.What are we going to need?We have our header component.Okay.And we want to have a stories component for it.We could actually just steal this, which is not a bad idea.It's going to give us some ideas as well.And why not?So we've got the header stories there.So I'm not a big fan of just having the stories folder.I prefer just to put my stories into the components instead.That way when I do so, then it's just going to sit in that folder with it.I like to keep them together.Let's do that.Okay.No, I don't want that.I don't want to hear from stories.I want the header, which is this one.Okay.So it's doing that.Now already we've got a difference here.It's got an argument of a name.This is a pretty good idea.We'll leave it at that, I think.Use this not a bad idea to show on our header component.Let's actually go back to our storybook.Not a storybook, our sketches of what we actually did for design.Because that would probably be helpful.Let's have a look at the ScalaDrawer.Okay.Did we have a username in there?No.Okay.That's okay.We don't need to have the same.So we'll just take that out for now.Sorry, I haven't switched screen.So that's our ScalaDrawer.Looking at it now, our homepage.Simply got the

appending a unique identifier on the end of the class.It uses the component name and then followed by the class name that you have in your module folder with the underscore.And then of course the unique identifier.That way, it should always be unique and you shouldn't get any CSS sort of clashes with that.So one of the benefits of using CSS modules.The other cool side of that, because everything has been put inside its own file.When you come to get rid of the component, you can feel comfortable in removing that CSS file at the same time.It's got some cons.One being, you could end up with a, if you're not diligent about your CSS styling, you could end up with a whole lot of repeated sort of classes in those individual modules.So you may need at some point to go back and

we're just going to crash now.I'm only running the storybook.Secondly, our header component does not sit in any of our actual layout for the app itself yet.It's purely sitting standalone and our storybook.Cool thing about that is that because it's standalone in our storybook, we can do a few things inside of our storybook here and we can sort of test for likes of different sizes.So if you actually have a look here, it looks like a cool thing.That's working correctly.So we've got the small.We can do that.Okay, so we have small mobile layer so we can actually have a small view of it.We can have a large mobile tablet and sort of reset it can be like it is top.So it's all there.Quite cool.We've also got the likes of what else we got here.We've got the flight grid view.So you can see it's good for the background.You can change the background or preview for an image there if you would like.There's a ruler just really cool to the showing.So using sort of one room there, which is 16 pixels in this case for our padding.And you can see that is displayed there with the measurements plug in.This is all this is all default to a storybook.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"mPBcG7/lMZicUfA3bZkxZMbhEOCG9lOzM1If3ZE1FfY="},"9796d660-7e9a-4aee-98de-ccfb57295aca":{"id_":"9796d660-7e9a-4aee-98de-ccfb57295aca","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","private":"false"},"hash":"zEkxOGML2n7dLUPM4YlE+8CxsnimfJHMQbEhv3fITSo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8e923259-7f8f-4baa-91bd-379a24656114","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","private":"false"},"hash":"gmUXLwAThap5rkVfJMz/PoLTmh0sY6CFnpX8MNlbqi4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"76e8e9d5-9872-43b0-9c8e-59ddf575a881","metadata":{},"hash":"o5DZw+DDpEX25uoelNgvpMc2WQaNIEjKjFJW/TouffQ="}},"text":"This

component is built as well.Cool.OK, so go to LMS.We have our logo.Now at the start of the project, cast your mind back.I imported the Radix components.So let's just double check that that's all up and going.So if we go into project here, we have the Radix UI theme.OK, so we're using that in our project.Cool.So what I'm going to do is what you should always do when you are working on projects.Try to commit often.I think we're at a good point.We've got it.We've got storybook set up.We've got our header component displaying.We know that our CSS modules are working correctly.And we can actually check that in now, feel confident that it's looking pretty good.So let's do that.So I added a storybook.Project.And set up header component.So commit that.And we'll sync those changes.Awesome.Like I said, we've got Radix there.If we jump back to the likes of Chrome.Let's do that.So.Got our LMS.Now, let's go and take a look at the Radix UI library again.OK.So we've already done this part.We've already set this up.Part of our project.Now, the reason we're using this library, we've got a whole lot of pre-configured components that we can use out of the box.We don't have to start from scratch.So that's why we're using them.Another good important point about them is they have some good defaults already set up in terms of accessibility.So we can continue with that.OK, so let's go down to this layout here.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ZczqXwLxUySprZmgDouTGjT5OeK+uhYOq2E2n6B7254="},"76e8e9d5-9872-43b0-9c8e-59ddf575a881":{"id_":"76e8e9d5-9872-43b0-9c8e-59ddf575a881","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","private":"false"},"hash":"zEkxOGML2n7dLUPM4YlE+8CxsnimfJHMQbEhv3fITSo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9796d660-7e9a-4aee-98de-ccfb57295aca","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md","private":"false"},"hash":"zfJ3fWn8LVwZmriznp08UAWCOxnugXDGFgd5aoLcjt4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"67ef9251-69f0-46ed-86dd-9687ba70740d","metadata":{},"hash":"H9W4S3cK9rkrP+6ODItlePJyyHhZxnOvJuOyviWYplI="}},"text":"So

awesome.Layout.OK.We could just use our own CSS to perform our layout.But one of the benefits of using something like this library is that we can use that to instead have that consistency.We can sort of step back and just have our CSS modules for the styling of things which are completely custom, which aren't as part of the Radix UI.So we'll use what we've already got set up here.So there is some layout components already.We've got a box, flex and grid, which is awesome.So we can set up our.looking back to our design.OK.Pretty basic setup.Logo on the left, menu on the right.We want to do that sort of layout.So a good way that we could do that, we could use maybe the flex layout, which would allow us to do that quite easily.We could actually use a good layout as well.Probably not needed.I'm

we can actually incorporate it into our own custom styles, which is pretty cool.We're going to apply a theme to this project using Radix.Radix is UI themes.And then what we can do from there is we can

much.Think about it maybe in terms of our color.OK.So this is all the theme colors here.So with that, we would have a color of amber.These are all the tokens.We go back to the help.Let's see.So they got T file font size.So if we grab this, that's the modifying of it, but we'd be able to see all the tokens like that.OK, so we can use these for our project.So we've got font size one.We've got weight, bold, default font family.It's a whole lot there is accessible to us.We can grab these as the CSS variables that they are.And we can apply it to our own styling.So let's give it actually a try

I'm running out of time.So what we can do next time we come back to the project, we can further explore how we can get, I guess, the Radix UI theming into our storybook.Because at the moment, it doesn't actually seem like we're actually getting, we are getting our custom styles from the modules, but we're not getting our custom styles from the Radix UI because we're not embedding anything.So a quick way we could quickly test that maybe is add a button.But we have run out of time, unfortunately.So next time what I'll do is configure using the Radix UI buttons.We'll test the theming and structure out.But have a play yourself.Storybook's really good for doing this building of components in isolation.It's got some great testing tools.It's also got some accessibility tools built in as well.Have a check of those.Some of those are really great.And of course you can have all your properties based on, if you want to have like we had before, we had the primary button and the non-primary button by setting that boolean value.Then it was going to show that color, the accent color on our buttons.Cool stuff.So next time, like I said, we'll get that Radix UI set up and we'll go through and make sure that it's working and continue on with our header component.Alright, thank you for watching.Please remember to like and subscribe.And if you want, you can ring the bell.You'll get notified

to the Superbase dashboard Okay, so I've got this this is my project the LMS one And I've got no tables in it at present.So I'm gonna create a new table just like the guide showed us and I'm gonna insert some data into it as well Of course on this one, I'm not gonna be adding countries.I am going to be adding some courses for the LMS So let's go and do so So create a new table.No, you want to pluralize the name of course, so courses.I'll disable RLS for now.You probably wouldn't want to do this.Actually, no, I'll keep it on.Let's keep it on.I'll do something else instead.thinking through.So we're gonna have the likes of a new public table, we're gonna have an ID and it's created at.This is a nice little simple user interface.You can do the same using some SQL but the interface is pretty good in terms of that.So let's do that.Okay so we're gonna need a few things I guess for a course name, a course name, so I'm going to have a name here and it's going to be some text.Or Basha, Basha probably would be better.And I'm going to add a description.Again, this one I will actually make a text.And I'm going to add another column here for some.We need to have an image, I think.Let's do that.Now, I think it could have us as some data, but probably the easiest thing to do in this scenario.Of course, we don't want to to load out a database or anything like that.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"JOBQ1ba7p3jUY+3IfcbV4yoGXZaspLz1zt/gGT0L8PM="},"3848b3ee-493b-4abf-b009-73486b328581":{"id_":"3848b3ee-493b-4abf-b009-73486b328581","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-supabase.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-supabase.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-supabase.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-supabase.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-supabase.md","private":"false"},"hash":"5yLNgBnQV0BWvN7yduacKE6tKwlDFzm7vT8Jy1mnzyI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ed1cdec6-8106-40ad-a372-67886d0a1954","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-supabase.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-supabase.md","private":"false"},"hash":"dOIckTIkXpBO/MRFYRqmU8cwgyWjo94haN3lNolDUfk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"853b28dc-d01c-419e-a662-18697d7e4bdd","metadata":{},"hash":"3v75T7KRFMltUJCkzPRjqfbIWXI/0GXZ+6bNmNpTau4="}},"text":"Of

project on the GitHub, I actually already have this.Let's pop this up so you guys can see as well.Let me see.So we've got this yellow mess here.Okay, so in here I have a local env example.So what you're going to need to do is go into your settings for Superbase here, just like the link here, follow this link here, it'll take you to the API page, you'll have a URL you'll have an anonymous key.You'll need to put those into an .env file and something like that.nv.local, that's a good place to start.Add those keys in there and that's what I've already done.So if we look at my code.Okay, so just like I said, I've got an example file here, you'd add those keys in there.Make sure you stop and start so that you get your environment keys to load because without it your app won't reload the environment variables unless you do that.Okay so once you've done that you've added those keys in there.We can go back to the tutorial.Okay and it's got an example here.They've got a page that they've created, so countries page.Okay so that's for a type script file and what they've done is they've created a component, used the cookies there to import the header there and then it does a call off to the Superbase library and gets the countries for that.So for those that maybe have done some SQL in the past it pretty much is very much a similar sort of look to SQL for Superbase.So their whole, I guess their model for being able to retrieve from your tables, again using a from there, there's your word in the select statement, and you've got a this select statement at the end there, hand by default I believe, having no value in the actual brackets there means that you're going to get all the columns on the table.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"vv3uAvg1ttaDBIWFvkA5FRa9b7BwLMVqQ7K/IRIlx0U="},"3e712926-5ea4-4e89-ad1d-063d855d5649":{"id_":"3e712926-5ea4-4e89-ad1d-063d855d5649","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-supabase.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-supabase.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-supabase.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-supabase.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-supabase.md","private":"false"},"hash":"5yLNgBnQV0BWvN7yduacKE6tKwlDFzm7vT8Jy1mnzyI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ae04d65d-1839-4cd4-91fd-f2a24d49c45d","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-supabase.md","file_name":"build-a-full-stack-next-js-supabase.md","private":"false"},"hash":"PYq4cKznTxTDYKU+nxEdiV32/NJSBFPL2beSJqBVBgo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"7c802a48-441c-4976-bb6c-6f2ee9f699cb","metadata":{},"hash":"o+j8OAOM0tmxaaOzWTjFmTjI417gPlCwFXgTReVg4uk="}},"text":"So

of Next.js, it has a quite basic setup in terms of the app router, layout being the actual what's going to be displayed in terms of layout, and page is the actual sort of content for it.So if we look at layout there, we've got a layout we're loading in some styles etc.\n\nwhich is all cool.Now let's go and go and add a new folder.Okay, so the App Router works basically by having a new folder name and in it you can have a page file.So I'm going to have a folder called countries.Like that.Okay, so we've got the countries and we're going to need a page file.All right.And we're going to need to have a component on there.So what would that look like?That could be something along the lines of this maybe.So we're just typing that out.We're going to export a export default and we're going to need to have this be async because we're going to be pulling in data for this home component.Maybe I should just call it, call it horses.Okay and in that we will need to have, we're going to actually import the Superbase library.So if you haven't, we probably should actually check to see if we've got this installed.Always we won't be able to.Yes I have installed it in the past.Okay So what you could do in terms of that is go to the command line, run npm install and superbase js and superbase auth help as an xjs as dependencies that look something like this.And we can take those same two

like this.Okay, so the cookie's there.and we then need to have a way to retrieve data.Look at that, it's actually even, it's copied the same bit of text there that is sitting on the, probably enough, the tutorial.We're not going to grab from the countries, we're going to grab from the courses And like I mentioned before, it's very much like an SQL statement.So you've got the from there, so the

to do so is go into our table and what we can do for it is set the policies on it.Okay, let's view policies.And what we want to actually do is we want to make a new policy for this.They've got some,

want to enable red axis to everyone here.So if I use this template that's going to let me apply that.You've got really granular control here with Superbase in it.you can actually set what operations

structure.And I'll probably call pause on this today.We're probably at the sort of starting point of now actually getting to the nitty gritty of actually building elements into our app.So we'll start creating some of these tables here.What I will do is I will also publish or any changes I've made and commit them and push to GitHub.For those that are following along, you'd be able to pull down the latest version of the app and you'll be able to see where it is.And then what I might also do is I might actually grab the SQL for the tables and the data itself as well.So if you want to pull them into your own version of it, you can do that as well.Next time I'm going to go over fleshing out more that data structure.So what I'll do is we'll go into some database diagramming just so that we've got a clear picture and a head of what we are trying to build and then we'll implement that in Superbase.Okay, awesome.Thanks for watching and we'll see you next time.Please like and subscribe and

\"storybook-welcome.png\"\n---\n\nyoutube.com/embed/fpUPw9Yu5NA\n\nIn this guide, I will walk you through getting started creating your own UI Component library with ReactJS, TypeScript and Storybook.You will need Node.js installed as a prerequisite, so install this first (if not already installed).Open a terminal where you want to start working, we will create a new folder with our new project.We are using Create React App in this example but the steps are similar to ViteJS and NextJS.Run the following command:\n\n```shell\nnpx create-react-app your-ui-library-name --template typescript\n```\n\nThis will use CRA with the TypeScript template to create a new project.Next we will install Storybook.Make sure you are in the directory that contains your project using `cd your-ui-library-name`, replace `your-ui-library-name` with your own projects name.```shell\nnpx storybook init\n```\n\nThis will install Storybook in your project and add some default files.Let's get it running so we can make sure the installation went well.```shell\nnpm run storybook\n```\n\nYou should now see a welcome screen in your default browser like the following:\n\n{% image \"./storybook-welcome.png\", \"Storybook welcome screen\" %}\n\nWhen building a component UI library it's best to start building the smallest components that will make up the UI library.I suggest starting with some basic components like Headings & Buttons followed by common form controls.The storybook documentation on the welcome screen has a link to a great site quickly summarising component driven development.By default, Storybook creates a folder called `stories` that contains component files, stories files and CSS files all matching the appropriate component name.For example `header.css`, `Header.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"8feYf8EF4/kO6SEwkDQa1TjknAGkMN6PCUq86NT1Cqw="},"5ebf2a0b-1964-499b-8c26-021df9275b7a":{"id_":"5ebf2a0b-1964-499b-8c26-021df9275b7a","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/create-your-own-ui-component-library.md","file_name":"create-your-own-ui-component-library.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/create-your-own-ui-component-library.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/create-your-own-ui-component-library.md","file_name":"create-your-own-ui-component-library.md","private":"false"},"hash":"aRKdS+TYoXBqc5aUKBcDogqujl1EVzSSDYNZzUQj6oU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"e240f4f3-e910-4f84-b4ab-85ec2d7d3201","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/create-your-own-ui-component-library.md","file_name":"create-your-own-ui-component-library.md","private":"false"},"hash":"8feYf8EF4/kO6SEwkDQa1TjknAGkMN6PCUq86NT1Cqw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"7cbd13a0-6bd4-4404-a2cd-20fb72cddf1d","metadata":{},"hash":"UEyOBfZaOfO7e8D9ZMbrc+lNXzZzEtCNxvp8/jjU8ws="}},"text":"For example `header.css`, `Header.tsx` and `Header.stories.tsx`.My preference is to instead create a `components` and `pages` folder.In the components folder, I will have the component file, the stories file and the CSS module together as they are all part of the whole.I use the pages folder for the top-level components that are used by a router for example React Router.All my other components that are made up of the simple ones are also placed in the `components` folder, like a login form for example.We are now going to copy the `button.css`, `Button.stories.tsx` and `Button.tsx` files into the `components` folder.This is a great example to start with for our Button component.Now you can delete the `stories` folder created by Storybook.Create React App, NextJS etc support CSS Modules by default.CSS Modules let you use the same CSS class name in different files without worrying about naming clashes.Let's change this button component CSS file to `button.module.css`.Open `Button.tsx` and replace the reference to the `button.css` file with the following:\n\nFrom this:\n\n```ts\nimport \"./button.css\";\n```\n\nTo this:\n\n```ts\nimport styles from \"./button.module.css\";\n```\n\nIn the `Button.tsx` file you can see the properties for the component have been defined with `interface ButtonProps`.Notice the \"size\" with options of small, medium and large.We are going to make some adjustments to the CSS and logic of the component to work with CSS Modules.Open the `button.module.css` file and rename the CSS classes from kebab-case to camelCase.We will also rename to a more generic name, by removing the \"storybook\" from the class names.{% image \"./rename-css.png\", \"Rename CSS from kebab case to camel case\" %}\n\nNow we need to update the button component with the class names from the CSS module.```tsx\nexport const Button = ({\n  primary = false,\n  size = \"medium\",\n  backgroundColor,\n  label,\n  ...props\n}: ButtonProps) => {\n  const mode = primary ?styles.buttonPrimary :

in real-time.Which is great for testing purposes.{% image \"./storybook-button.png\", \"Storybook documentation for our button\" %}\n\nI've also added another example for headings, that allows you to select from h1-h6.{% image \"./storybook-heading.png\", \"Storybook documentation for a heading component\" %}\n\nNow keep creating more components for your own UI library piece by piece.You can test and check your components in Storybook independent of the web app, configuring all sorts of different property combinations.If you would like to view the source code for my example it's available on GitHub.For more guides on how to use Storybook to create your own UI Component library check out the tutorial section at the storybook

that we've just created.Now I like to use dev containers when I'm working on projects.Open the command palette, command shift p or control shift p and select dev\ncontainers add dev container configuration file, then add it to the workspace\nand type in **Nodejs & Typescript** and use the defaults there.Once this is finished a alert will say to reopen any container and we want to do\nthis to load it under docker.You will also be asked to rebuild the container.Once that completes the terminal will allow us to install the latest version of\nstorybook to follow through the defaults here.```sh\nnpx storybook@latest init\n```\n\nNow close the little pop-up here and use **Ctrl + C** to end the terminal\nsession.Now let's ensure all our packages are installed.I like to use the prettier code formatter so I make sure that I've got the\nextension installed.Now let's open up a terminal, install the prettier package\nand let's make a new file for the prettier config.```sh\nnpm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier\n```\n\n`prettierrc.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tabWidth\": 2,\n  \"semi\": true,\n  \"singleQuote\": false,\n  \"arrowParens\": \"avoid\"\n}\n```\n\nSo that's `prettierrc.json` and then we add the json config that we want to use.Under the storybook directory we want to start by opening up the `main.ts` file\nand then we're going to add some add-ons to it.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"iQMVpgVfH+33T5GozLdWYo5mEeko/CC7Tm/c4N2kE5E="},"8740c5d2-e200-4c31-a653-6576a36cf0e5":{"id_":"8740c5d2-e200-4c31-a653-6576a36cf0e5","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/custom-components-mui.md","file_name":"custom-components-mui.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/custom-components-mui.md_2","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/custom-components-mui.md","file_name":"custom-components-mui.md","private":"false"},"hash":"i6dlD+pwxqkQpuJzU7bEimpUXcg6kS+KxBlv8HivyGY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9f9b32c5-3ce0-420e-a42a-36ccc5df14e0","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/custom-components-mui.md","file_name":"custom-components-mui.md","private":"false"},"hash":"iQMVpgVfH+33T5GozLdWYo5mEeko/CC7Tm/c4N2kE5E="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"656ebed2-b243-4601-9c06-d1d6b5cc9615","metadata":{},"hash":"V5doiejOeAO1aMuoYHKgBaPoYmEakixymd4W06bxjsQ="}},"text":"ts`

can see we've got a label so we can change that and we should be able to see\nthe changes reflected.\n\nWe can also change the size and the variant for the button.\n\nSo now let's open up the button

Custom Datatable Component\n\nNow let's create our new component `DataTable.tsx`.GitHub Source - DataTable.tsx\n\nNow this one's going to be a bit more customized in the sense that we've got a\nlot of elements that are going to make up the component.So this is the data table and in it it will need to import a whole lot of\ncomponents.As you can see here there's table, table body, table cell, table container,\ntable head and table row.Next we'll make an interface for the data for the table and interface for the\nheader cell.And an interface for the table header props made up of the header cells.The table props come next where we've got the data, the head cell and whether\nthe table is zebra striped.So we're going to need a table header component which is going to take the\nproperties needed for that header row.And now for the component itself which is the data table.We can de-structure the props for the table into the variables we want to use.We're now going to use the esx prop which is a shortcut used for defining custom\nstyles that also has access to the theme.So now I've made a SX variable and if the property for zebra striped is true\nthen it's going to set the background color to the gray that's available from\nmui.We're going to add the table container, table header etc and to the table row\ncomponent we're going to add the sx object to the sx props.So that's going to allow us to customize the table row to show the zebra\nstriping if it has been set to true.We now need to make a data table stories file `DataTable.stories.tsx`.GitHub Source - DataTable.stories.tsx\n\nAnd like previously we need to import the component and we also need to create a\nutilities file.We're going to create our data on top of that.As usual we need to pull in the meta and the story object.And then we need to set these meta so that it gets all the properties.Now of course we need to export that, create the story.We need to make a set of data for the

there as you can see and the header cells.We're now going to make a zebra striped example.Looking back in the browser we're going to look at the data table and you can\nsee the docs have all rendered there and we've got an example here.On the following one we have the zebra stripes because we have the zebra striped\nvalue set to true.So you can see in the example here I have put a minimum width of 300 pixels and\nwhen we try to close it to that size it stays at that minimum width.It's common with responsive design that you want to have different breakpoints\nand show different sizes so you can do this with the esx prop by using the\narray.So in the first example here the breakpoint is for the larger size and it's set\nto be the 750 pixel mark.Now if we make the viewport smaller we can see

300.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"smSdUZLk5LN2K8v9Cn0qlKf9C6kIgonQzZhuckybzEE="},"38664cf9-6715-417b-8b82-3702bffaabd2":{"id_":"38664cf9-6715-417b-8b82-3702bffaabd2","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/custom-components-mui.md","file_name":"custom-components-mui.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/custom-components-mui.md_6","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/custom-components-mui.md","file_name":"custom-components-mui.md","private":"false"},"hash":"qbCqIbil0mT58JK9nGpzrucQZpxboIJ9Yi/qLaXB1g4="}},"text":"##

teacher for about two years in software development and I just thought I'd like to share some more knowledge while I can.Well I've got some free time anyway.Okay what are dev containers?So a dev container is a pre-configured development environment that is packaged up as a container image.This image includes all of the tools and dependencies that are needed to develop a particular application.These dev containers can be used to create a consistent development experience for developers, regardless of their operating system or machine configuration.So Mac, Linux, Windows.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Rao27rb1NxtEkPKFSdRrE5XurIWeAQ96WCJrZ5UN1Kg="},"7d957ac9-85ea-4454-890a-b87d67475ce0":{"id_":"7d957ac9-85ea-4454-890a-b87d67475ce0","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","file_name":"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","file_name":"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","private":"false"},"hash":"f34b+Ie6PX0feefP9+/oL0/H3z6BMylV64cBpcvWz4o="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4a147d84-3290-4855-8c59-fe291e3b59c7","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","file_name":"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","private":"false"},"hash":"Rao27rb1NxtEkPKFSdRrE5XurIWeAQ96WCJrZ5UN1Kg="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"43a49f10-f37c-4487-b5c8-4d81d65e8e1f","metadata":{},"hash":"qU9z6oIFD1a4hufxcS+DO0c5gWzaEobzV7Pp521OQ4Y="}},"text":"So Mac, Linux, Windows.They can also be used to improve the productivity of developers by providing them with a ready-to-use environment that does not require any setup or configuration.So these dev containers are typically created using a tool like Docker and VS Code.And Docker provides a way to create and manage container images.And to create the dev container, you first need to create a devcontainer JSON file.This file specifies the contents of the container image.The devcontainer json file can be used to install tools, dependencies, and configure the environment.So a big part of software development is dependencies and managing your environment.So this can take care of that for you.Why would you want to use devcontainers?Devkit containers can be a valuable tool for improving the development experience.They can help to create a consistent development environment, improve productivity and reduce the risk of errors.That's all stuff we want to do.As we develop things, okay, so consistency.That's a big one.Consistent development experience.Okay, so dev containers can help to create a consistent development experience for developers regardless of their operating system or machine configuration.So this can help to improve productivity and reduce the risk of errors.So stopping that tool works on my machine, but doesn't work on yours that kind of thing the improved productivity is is dev containers can help to improve the productivity by providing developers with a ready-to-use environment that does not require any setup or configuration.We love that, don't we?Being able to just get started without having to battle through a config.So that can save a whole little time and frustration.Reduce risk of errors.So dev containers can help to reduce the risk of errors by isolating the development environment from the production environment.This can help to prevent errors from being introduced in the production environment.Hey people, integrated with VS Code, but development experience is much nicer than working with Docker containers alone.So one cool thing is with VS Code and the containers is that the terminal can actually be looking at the container itself, which is pretty awesome.So it's a UI one there.Another real benefit of it is the ability to run in Codespaces.What are Codespaces, you're probably asking?","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"naM8AjMs/iM7WOYGl02xV/4nJejclOOQlPmFkbaOhLA="},"43a49f10-f37c-4487-b5c8-4d81d65e8e1f":{"id_":"43a49f10-f37c-4487-b5c8-4d81d65e8e1f","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","file_name":"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","file_name":"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","private":"false"},"hash":"f34b+Ie6PX0feefP9+/oL0/H3z6BMylV64cBpcvWz4o="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7d957ac9-85ea-4454-890a-b87d67475ce0","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","file_name":"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","private":"false"},"hash":"OlpoAPOCO7NFaZesXAOORk4+xomRPE429qQn8ucVX98="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"0d619a30-6146-424e-8868-e7e035b02895","metadata":{},"hash":"AQuNwjzfcpFLQUR+2K7G5dfFZKCWc0uTNgo8oQFxUvI="}},"text":"What are Codespaces, you're probably asking?So it's basically a thing that GitHub has, where you can run one of these dev containers on a machine in the cloud.And you can do all your development.You can even share it with other developers.You can show off what you're working on.And it's all pretty much just a quick way of sharing what you're currently working on.Maybe you've got some really big requirements.Maybe you're working on a low spec machine and you need something with a lot of RAM.With the dev containers there, you could specify that machine to have a whole lot of RAM, and then you'd be able to use that in the cloud.Now you can use that in VS Code, or you can even use it in a browser, which is pretty cool.Okay, the other cool thing with Dev Containers is that it's easy swapping between projects with different dependencies.Say you had a project that was using Node.js 16 and this new one needed 20.By running the containers, neither version will be installed on your local file system.Instead, it's going to be sitting in those containers and it's going to keep your computer craft free, which is really handy.As you can imagine, every time that you'd want to have to switch between to node 16 and 20, you'd have to use some other tool to do that.And the same thing could be had between, say, different versions of Python or .NET Core for starters.And being able to easily switch between them just by running up a container means we don't have to worry about what's installed on your machine.Okay so if you're looking away to improve the development experience, Dev Containers are a great option and they can help to create that consistent development environment that will improve productivity and reduce the risk of errors.Cool.A few friendly faces that I can see in the chat there, hi everyone.Okay, so let's get into, let's look at the docs.That's what I always like to do before I get started with anything.Let's jump to

jump to code.visualstudio.com.Okay, so this code website, it's got some really great content here what are dev containers and what they're all about etc.\n\nProbably the big one to look at is this image here and this might help sort of cement this visual model of what is actually happening.Okay so on the left you've got the local operating system and inside that you've got the VS code, you've got the theme, your UI, your extensions, blah blah blah.But you've also got the source code.Okay so that's all sitting on your local machine.So you've pulled down, cloned down a repo down to your machine and you've now got that source code there.You've got the vs code, pretty much the same as what you're used to.It's pretty normal.But when you have a devcontainer.json file, one of the things that the yes code will do is it will pop up a little pop up saying \"Would you like to open this in a container?\"And when it does that, so what just like as you would if you typed docker from the client line or docker compose with a docker file, that would then pull down those image, set that up locally on your machine and then make it available to work on.Okay so what does it do?You can see there on the right in the container you've got this VS Code server.So what it actually does is it actually runs VS Code the server which is another open source project, runs that locally in that container, it mounts the source code that's sitting on your machine and then with that container there you've got the file system, you've got the terminal process, you've got the running application debugger, all those are accessible from the VS Code server and VS Code opens that port and can read that VS Code server there and so it's just literally imaging what is in that same container.Cool.Okay so let's actually let's go through set up a small project and we'll add a dev container to it and so you can see how it actually works.Okay let's get started with that.So we're going to jump to Visual Studio Code here.So I've got that open.Pre-work visits you're going to need

going to need is this extension here, which is dev containers.I'm going to copy that, paste that into the chat for those that want to have a look.Hang on, I'll get the right link here.So this is the extension ID here.If you do search for that in your own VS code, that should come up with the right one.And you're going to need to install it of course.It's got a few other prerequisites and it will sort itself out for you.Okay so once that's installed you've got Docker installed up and running, you've got your VS Code, let's make a project.So you'd either clone something or start fresh like I'm doing right now.I'm just going to clear that.Okay so I'm going to use Next we use the create next app to start building a little project that we're going to add, make it a dev container.Okay so NPX, maybe something I've prepared earlier, there we go, create next app at latest.So it's going to use the latest version there of next.Hit enter, cool okay, my mixed dev container there we go, the name for the project.We're not going to use TypeScript, I am going to use eslint, we'll use Tailwind, fix the source directory, add router and we're not going to customize the import there.Okay probably seen this before if you've used next.Great way to get started with a project.It sets all your templates up for you.You can see there it's installing all those.Awesome.Okay so now we've got a project sitting under there.My next dev container.So I'm going to start.And there.And I'll start going up from the command line there.All right.Zoom in a little bit.Make it easier to read.How are we looking?Cool.Okay.Normal sort of node project, JavaScript project.If we open it up, okay, so we've got some layout files, page etc.\n\nPretty much standard what we've been always used

enough, it's the top of my list here because it's recently been used.Dev containers add dev container configuration files.Okay, when I add that it gives me a whole lot of options.There's pretty much every single sort of image you can think of.You know, you can use standard Alpine, Debian, got some node ones and what we're gonna do is I'm gonna choose this one so this is a node.js and a PostgreSQL container.Okay I'm gonna add that I'm just gonna use the default there of 20 and what I can also do is I can actually install a whole lot of other features.So why would you want to do this?You can see at the top there there's one password CLI.So that's a if you use 1 password you can use that to you know do your logins etc.\n\nYou can do it all straight from the terminal inside the container.And of course you've got plenty of other options here.Anaconda and people doing some builds or something.App packages, maybe you want to update the container.Even Astro CLI.Yeah there's quite a few options there.Are those default options actually?Let's do all.I can find it.The common.I probably won't have to select it because it's already, yeah it's already part of it I believe.But the common utilities case things like OhMyZSH and a few other nice little to haves.I'm gonna add it, it's not gonna hurt.Okay and I'm gonna click OK there.The defaults will be pretty pretty much what you need.We'll just go through them just to have a quick look but you can see there it's just this configuration of those common there.So whatever you are adding in terms of software.It's going to give you some options

see there.So what we have here we're looking at the dev container json file so this is what's just been added.It's got a few things pre-configured there it's got the name of it, nodejs + postgressql so that was the container that we selected first up.It's got for those sort of used docker before you probably would have seen a docker compose file and you can also see there on the right there is a docker file okay so what are we gonna do with the little pop-ups gone we're not gonna panic for starters but we can bring that back up again so if we do Command + Shift + P okay and go dev containers

done is what we would normally have to do if we were using just Docker alone, we'd go into the directory, we'd start docker compose, of course it would look at the compose file, start the docker and we'd all be running in that container.Okay, You'll notice one little sort of point of difference when you are running under a container there.You can see down in the bottom left here, okay, so it's saying that we are editing on Dev Container, Nodejs and Postgres SQL.And it's basically if you pop that open, you've got a few other options here for things like attaching to the running container, you can configure the container features, all that kind of thing.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"l9cSjnmiaNnEwnl6h/50eFFQAa8j/kCyvzemv/X/sSI="},"7d372c87-6335-4ad8-b46d-9df1197d51ab":{"id_":"7d372c87-6335-4ad8-b46d-9df1197d51ab","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","file_name":"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","file_name":"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","private":"false"},"hash":"f34b+Ie6PX0feefP9+/oL0/H3z6BMylV64cBpcvWz4o="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"121bb992-ed7a-4d70-bbfb-de477a497f05","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","file_name":"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","private":"false"},"hash":"wnrs6TC4nWx/csZZCKCu5E2+Sk35/z6XGFS0RnXAxlM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"b924f6a7-39d4-4f1b-a3a4-44e5cdd30388","metadata":{},"hash":"pvD7iThjTyYWdYqfWVV8koviCyjGvXAm5/Q/331bBLY="}},"text":"And like I mentioned previously, you can even create a new code space with it.Okay, I'm gonna start a new terminal.Okay, you've noticed anything about my terminal that it looks slightly different.So when we were in the VS Code previously, I definitely wasn't in a WorkSpaces folder, I was in my developer folder I believe, and I had a YouTube folder where I've created this project.So what we're actually looking at when we're looking at the terminal right now is what's in the container there.How do we prove this.So we can do something like this.We can see the version there.Okay so it's saying that the node version there is version 20.Okay like when I, if you can cast your mind back you may want to jump back in the video later after we finished.But you would have seen when I was setting up the devcontainer.json file there was this section there of the version of node for that image and it was version 20.And when I selected that, that of course has installed that version.Okay so hopefully a lot of you, some of you may be more seasoned developers remember the pain of trying to support maybe a legacy application.Maybe it's running on an old version of node and you really want to install that but you don't want to have to go through maybe breaking your dev environment for something else that you've got running.So these dev containers are a way for you, maybe you're working on something in node 16, and maybe you're working on another project in node 20.Because they're all self-contained in these containers, and the whole development experience feels just like you're developing locally, you get a premium experience with the ability to have any dependencies that you need they're sitting in those containers and available to you at minus notice, which is way better than having to change all your whole configuration again.I've got one question in the chat.So the dev container JSON is used to generate the Docker files or it has other uses as well.So what does it have?Let's get back to it.Okay, I'll just close the terminal.Okay, OK.It's got basically, let's just go through each part first.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"U5L3qN5+HnkMHduG1Z1wJ7E6dFmVP2fJhVXPlzU5uo4="},"b924f6a7-39d4-4f1b-a3a4-44e5cdd30388":{"id_":"b924f6a7-39d4-4f1b-a3a4-44e5cdd30388","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","file_name":"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","file_name":"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","private":"false"},"hash":"f34b+Ie6PX0feefP9+/oL0/H3z6BMylV64cBpcvWz4o="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7d372c87-6335-4ad8-b46d-9df1197d51ab","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","file_name":"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","private":"false"},"hash":"PuF7FqYFtnRvApB+Eskg0z6LpkcvVxzWyO3q0jAZQJA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"44684fa8-9a3a-4b46-a233-9d2aff516eba","metadata":{},"hash":"u7jY64rnSB1SFm5YV0go85Qq++DZjr29X2oEWWJgbb8="}},"text":"Okay, OK.It's got basically, let's just go through each part first.So first of all, you've got a name so you can rename this to whatever you would like.You've got the docker compose file so it's actually created a docker compose file there in this directory.We'll have a look at that in a sec.And you've got a docker file.For those that maybe you've looked at a Docker compose or Docker file before and then we have a service and a service has the name.So this is actually linking to that app straight out of the box.We've not had to set that all up for us and again the WorkSpaces folder again has been pre-configured for us again using that base folder name.So when we were looking at that previously in the terminal we could see, was it my dev container.Okay, also this dev container has things like the features there, so we've got all the features configuration there for zsh.And not only that, you can also set up, which is probably what a lot of people would like, is things like port forwarding.So you got the port 3000, which is the standard port for Next.js and we've also got the standard port there for Postgres.Okay so that's going to make the container have those ports open to us so that we're going to be able to use other tools to be able to view things like things like browser and I'm going show you it's sort of using a RMS tool to be able to connect to a database.So again we've got all that set up and we've got the ports.One other thing that we can do which again making this whole developer experience much more smoother.What's normally the first thing you do when you have a no project when you want to get started.That is that you're going to have to install an A module, don't you?And so one way to automate that whole process is we do actually have the ability to have this post create command.So once the container has all been created, we can use this post create command to then fire off the, in our case I'm going to use npm, install here and then I don't have to go through the hassle there of going to actually happen to menu and do it.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"PWvUIiI/7I3hBdBy3suyoOvde7imMFtoYGBh0Yq18Ak="},"44684fa8-9a3a-4b46-a233-9d2aff516eba":{"id_":"44684fa8-9a3a-4b46-a233-9d2aff516eba","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","file_name":"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","file_name":"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","private":"false"},"hash":"f34b+Ie6PX0feefP9+/oL0/H3z6BMylV64cBpcvWz4o="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b924f6a7-39d4-4f1b-a3a4-44e5cdd30388","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","file_name":"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","private":"false"},"hash":"pvD7iThjTyYWdYqfWVV8koviCyjGvXAm5/Q/331bBLY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f6c8ae75-fe60-497c-9d0b-9c262852aaad","metadata":{},"hash":"WTCR/p5e4+mxaoCls+eGWTf8UDKJ7i+/rMPaBYRNm1o="}},"text":"I

of refactoring.So because the dev containers are all self-contained, we could use an older version and not have to worry about an effecting our local machine.Let's go back to VS Code there.Alright.Okay, let's just have a quick walk through this compose file.Again, like I said, very much the same.It's got the services as you normally would have.It's got the app and it's got the bb.And it's got that all ready to rock because you've got the environment variables there and the volume mount all set up ready.So this project now is actually running in a container.I can refresh, I can do just like as I normally would if I was working on an Next.js project.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ZSmhEu3RTg9s6cmpDzMzcP/Opb0SH+sKAg6BHgRYlpQ="},"5635e76d-9602-450f-91dc-e571a30c371e":{"id_":"5635e76d-9602-450f-91dc-e571a30c371e","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","file_name":"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","file_name":"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","private":"false"},"hash":"f34b+Ie6PX0feefP9+/oL0/H3z6BMylV64cBpcvWz4o="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f6c8ae75-fe60-497c-9d0b-9c262852aaad","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","file_name":"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md","private":"false"},"hash":"WTCR/p5e4+mxaoCls+eGWTf8UDKJ7i+/rMPaBYRNm1o="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"fe59995d-172c-4a19-be6a-250b1f283322","metadata":{},"hash":"zkNMFSASDCCPdxeLZdMVK1mYccpCnD6f//82v7f9wYU="}},"text":"js

could actually have and have multiple running as long as you're not using the same ports.So it's no different than running locally on your machine.Should I put a frog in there?Good idea Chelsea.Okay, alright.There's a frog.Oh frog time's sakes.Okay so that's there.Of course, got a little emoji there.Okay, this project is of course is, like I said, running in a container.And of course if I stop that container then it's going to stop working.So let's just pause.Let's stop everything actually.Stop it.Once that finishes.Straight away PS code realizes, hey something's gone wrong.like I was saying before, it's using that first code server so it's requiring that to be running to be able to connect to.Okay so I shouldn't be able to access this anymore.It's just going to spin the wheel and it's not going to load for a time out.Same for the database.We've got a question there in the chat.Are containers used in a production environment?Yes they can.So you can get quite complicated setups.Maybe you've already got a project that is already using Docker in your production environment.Maybe you've got a mono repo, maybe with sort of three different, maybe a server, a client, a database.Actually let's pull one up.Let's make this actually a bit more interactive.We'll pull one up rather than just talk about it.So what have I got here?This is the project I made a while ago.So I'll clone this down for my local machine and I'll walk through how it's kind of different to say like a traditional sort of docker setup and something you might be have in production with docker

just makes it a little bit easier to separate out all the three different parts of a mono repo.Okay, so this client, we have a docker file for your client, we have a docker file for the server, it's running a sort of pin sort of stack, so postgres, express, react, and node, and if we go down to here we can see we have a docker compose file.Okay so I can start this up just as I would normally.I can go docker-compose up and get that actual project up and running in a container which is perfectly fine.That's a that's a great way to to work and I probably wouldn't use a dev container as such if I had a project like this but we can.So we're going to show you how you can do that if you want to.So the easiest way to probably do that is we'll just close this.We're going to jump back into the

environment, of course, you're going to want to have sort of like a container like this.The good thing about it is you'd be able to, you know, set up a different container for each of the different parts of the the application.It should be sitting on their own version and of course you know if you were setting up something really big and chunky you'd probably use some sort of container

open best to keep that configuration in that dev container file and of course that's not going to impact your docker file, so if the project is already running in production etc it's just sort of sitting separate to it.The other cool thing with dev containers is that you can actually install extensions for a container.You know when I was going at the start where we were talking about the actual on the left was the browser page on the left you've got the VS code there you know with the extensions etc and a key thing there you've got a workspace extension so the cool thing is so if the project is you know where it's gonna need some of these extensions you can actually configure it to be set up so that when someone else comes along to start the project up they can have those extensions already ready to go installed on their machine as well.So let's do that.People can see that.Okay so you got no no containers on there as such.So say if I wanted to have I don't know what's something good.A spellcheeker.Okay.No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.Look at the icons they tell you.See?Yeah.What's something else?Docker?something that's actually probably, either the normal one would be maybe prettier.That's a pretty common one.So I can install in that dev container there.And so then your project would then have that listed.So if we see that, that's sort of locally installed.And now I've got this dev container here.Great for when you want to get some started with running up on a project and have all those extensions there they're going to help them with their development.Cool

that first project we had.Okay, so I'll reopen this container.Okay, that's better than me, it didn't work.How's that?That's good.OK, so I'll reopen this container.OK, that's better, the mute didn't

engineer, and full stack developer.I decided in August to take a side step in to teaching.While I had mentored many junior developers over my career this was something new and exciting to me.Getting the chance to impart my knowledge and skills on to a new generation of developers sounded exciting and fresh.Most importantly the job was remote too.Starting the job I had a two week window to get acquainted with what I'd be teaching and immerse myself in the content that had already been created (exercises and projects) before I started teaching.Once the term started and I was teaching two lessons a day to 25 students online via Google Meet.Teaching them first how to get Git set up on their computers and all the other software needed to start developing.While the first couple of lessons felt quite daunting, after a week I felt completely at ease with the students.I feel in the short time I've been teaching, my understanding of JavaScript and HTML/CSS has improved greatly.Even after using these technologies for **20 years**.When you have to explain how and why things work the way that they do you always want to be prepared for those questions from students.Because I can assure you they are going to ask hard questions.You continually want to keep improving your teaching style and approach too.There are even times you will have to change tact with how you are teaching mid lesson.It definitely keeps you on your toes.The biggest change I've found in my own well being is the feeling of satisfaction now with what I do in my job.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ncIzusm2V9/KaPhv55dIybVO5uL4CHYf6cH8VfotzZ8="},"e1dd70d5-9a60-45c5-9dd5-1eca65b4038c":{"id_":"e1dd70d5-9a60-45c5-9dd5-1eca65b4038c","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/full-stack-developer-to-instructor.md","file_name":"full-stack-developer-to-instructor.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/full-stack-developer-to-instructor.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/full-stack-developer-to-instructor.md","file_name":"full-stack-developer-to-instructor.md","private":"false"},"hash":"VowneqPzAWN7EAyDHak6HLGQilMKBVopqk5caSWU0K4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"be5bb93b-3cf0-4ddf-b9ad-a5edb2d7b63a","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/full-stack-developer-to-instructor.md","file_name":"full-stack-developer-to-instructor.md","private":"false"},"hash":"ncIzusm2V9/KaPhv55dIybVO5uL4CHYf6cH8VfotzZ8="}},"text":"While

I've been using LastFM for years to track my listening habits and I thought it would be great to use their API to do so. The hard part though was my site is \"static\" built with eleventy (11ty), it's a static site generator which means a build process puts all the files together and turns it into HTML every time I push commits to GitHub. The files are static and can't dynamically change like a Node.js or Wordpress website. So I needed a way to get the data from LastFM and display it on my site. I could have used a JavaScript fetch request to get the data, but that would mean exposing my API key to the world. I needed a way to get the data securely and Netlify (serverless) functions was the answer.\n\nHere is the transcript from my latest how-to guide on how to make a LastFM widget for your own website showing your last played song that uses Netlify functions (serverless functions).\n\nyoutube.com/embed/okbDFf-eIqk\n\n---\n\nHi everyone, it's Andrew here and I'm here to show you a new tutorial on how to build a last FM widget on your website.

It displays the last track I played that has been \"scrobbled\".\n\nCurrently, it's showing a track by Foals and if I play another song from another album like this one from The Beths, next time I refresh the page on my website it will show the latest one, played or playing.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":1879,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"1+WYUiaJiszqgmNRYU/IkOVhVJjaSm/erVKI7XRQgLc="},"670b74f8-76a5-4d88-8806-4fdc72262c09":{"id_":"670b74f8-76a5-4d88-8806-4fdc72262c09","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/lastfm-widget-netlify-functions.md","file_name":"lastfm-widget-netlify-functions.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/lastfm-widget-netlify-functions.md_2","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/lastfm-widget-netlify-functions.md","file_name":"lastfm-widget-netlify-functions.md","private":"false"},"hash":"46rGB6wQQ6TJ/+m8eaa3x7wnMGoI59FlD8qpBaQDkAk="}},"text":"### Create a LastFM API key\n\nWe're now gonna generate the last FM API key.

Create a Serverless function\n\nWith Netlify, it's very easy to add serverless functions to your project.Serverless functions, also known as Functions As A Service, are a way of building and running computer programs without needing to worry about the underlying servers or infrastructure.Instead, a cloud provider takes care of managing the servers and resources, and developers can just write and deploy their code.Serverless functions are triggered by specific events or requests and can quickly execute and shut down when they're finished.This makes them efficient, cost-effective and flexible, and they're often used for tasks that don't require continuous running or need to handle a lot of traffic.To be able to make a fetch request, I'm going to add the Node fetch package to my project, so we can make a get request from the Last FM API to get the last played track for my account.```sh\nnpm install -D node-fetch@3\n```\n\nOnce we have that setup, we can create a JavaScript function to make the get request return the result.I've made my function an imported node fetch, and then made a handler function for my get request.I then pulled in my API key from the environment file that we created, and then you can see here we have a request with the API key added as a string literal.I then created a last track object and retrieved the appropriate details from the JSON data requested and finally returned the result.You can see I have my Last FM username in the string for the URL that we're calling.You will need to replace that with your own username.```javascript\nimport fetch

instructor\n  - reflection\ndescription: A reflection on my practice as an instructor teaching Software Development at Developers Institute.---\n\nAs a software developer of twenty-plus years, changing my career focus to teaching software development has been a radical change.While I have lots of experience in software development, I only have limited teaching experience.This was previously gained on the job mentoring junior developers in the workplace.Of course, being relatively new to teaching, there is much room for personal improvement, especially on the learning theory side.But even though this time frame has been short, my teaching practices have constantly evolved through trial and error.Improved from advice from the rest of the teaching team and, most recently, from taking the DCTL course.The institute (Developers Institute) I work at has some critical points of difference in how we teach compared to most tertiary education providers.First, the entire school is remote only, learners and teaching teams alike.This heavily impacts our teaching process in all manner of study, teaching and assessment for our learners.We have to lean into digital learning every day.We follow the Community of Inquiry teaching model developed by Garrison, Anderson & Archer[^1] to facilitate this.So that engaged learning occurs, we must have interaction through the three core elements:\n\n- Social presence - which I do by using tools like Google Meet or Zoom so that the learners can see and hear their peers and me (we ask the learners to leave their cameras on, which improves social presence).They can ask questions, and we can interact on the call.- Cognitive presence - where to keep the learners engaged, I use digital tools such as Miro for online white-boarding, the screen can be shared on the video calling software, and the link to the board can be directly shared (via a browser) for the class.This can be helpful for the learners to go back and look at the board again after class or during the course to collaborate, letting learners add sticky notes and text etc., to fully engage with what is being taught.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"y67JL7xUM+csBQH35nTLkO7DOnhkhl04zBRjUhQ7KsI="},"5a283e22-b3ce-4fc6-8b0e-80ed28734275":{"id_":"5a283e22-b3ce-4fc6-8b0e-80ed28734275","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/reflecting-practice-instructor.md","file_name":"reflecting-practice-instructor.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/reflecting-practice-instructor.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/reflecting-practice-instructor.md","file_name":"reflecting-practice-instructor.md","private":"false"},"hash":"147gTsCY2YVGn58PlXXRt6QZAQlLcnGarKoqrIcgsI8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bf915aab-13a9-4dc0-b562-1e38a45e1670","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/reflecting-practice-instructor.md","file_name":"reflecting-practice-instructor.md","private":"false"},"hash":"y67JL7xUM+csBQH35nTLkO7DOnhkhl04zBRjUhQ7KsI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"ddc6e05a-ca44-4138-8d7d-fcb03b58c854","metadata":{},"hash":"49rLvJZOCBKt/LxzLD3x7gVCK5jrrwNA9nKZjviggok="}},"text":"- Teaching presence - During a call, I facilitate the class and guide the lesson, ensuring we keep on task.Starting discussion topics, asking guiding questions and offering help if required.There are a lot of benefits to a digital and collaborative online class environment.One of the biggest for the Developers Institute is equity and accessibility.All our students can access tertiary education no matter where they are located in the country.We provide them with a computer for the entirety of the course.The only other things they need to have are a good internet connection and a quiet place to study.If they have whānau they care for outside of a large centre, they are not disadvantaged.If they have young children to care for, they are not disadvantaged.They interact with learners and a teaching team located all over Aotearoa (New Zealand) with a wide diverse range of learners from all stages of life and cultures.The most challenging aspect of a digital remote online class environment is ensuring students actively engage in learning and get the required help.While remote, it may seem more challenging to keep an eye on how learners are engaging and progressing in their studies, but in fact, it's quite the opposite these days with the number of available tools we employ.For starters, we can track each learner's progress through their online classroom material in iQualify, and see those needing encouragement or help.View the progress of their exercise via GitHub Classroom, and offer relevant feedback specific to the context of their work.Keep in contact regularly via Slack and Google Meet.We also have a team that can answer their questions via a ticketing system and quickly get the learners the help they need.These tools are necessary to offer the level of support we do.To further the learning experience, I follow contemporary pedagogies in my teaching process.For example, I have used constructionism in my classes by running \"mob programming\" lessons where I get the learners to develop a web form using an online integrated development environment or IDE for short.This tool, called Replit allows the learners to collaborate on the same codebase in real time together.It will enable multiple people to work on the same code file simultaneously.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Z/lR6oH2IbwhSa6R9OBu1GjjzHJK5K+WMDZZ0n/p9KQ="},"ddc6e05a-ca44-4138-8d7d-fcb03b58c854":{"id_":"ddc6e05a-ca44-4138-8d7d-fcb03b58c854","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/reflecting-practice-instructor.md","file_name":"reflecting-practice-instructor.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/reflecting-practice-instructor.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/reflecting-practice-instructor.md","file_name":"reflecting-practice-instructor.md","private":"false"},"hash":"147gTsCY2YVGn58PlXXRt6QZAQlLcnGarKoqrIcgsI8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"5a283e22-b3ce-4fc6-8b0e-80ed28734275","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/reflecting-practice-instructor.md","file_name":"reflecting-practice-instructor.md","private":"false"},"hash":"lLQ2Hvm7xHBOHiVpY5pGopQIPhI3lBgQTb4HlPMfJ1U="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"99ce079d-81ae-4270-b97b-5e6fee93dafb","metadata":{},"hash":"KX0HlijjD1JUG6x6U/pqeM/7nm3RMygGew9Dv8gCM/E="}},"text":"It will enable multiple people to work on the same code file simultaneously.In conjunction with a video call, I can facilitate the class and let the learners take turns, discuss and suggest to one another what steps should be taken to build the web form.What I find in my classes in this scenario as learners help one another and discuss the merits of what they have built.The Learners who aren't always vocal engage more in the comfortable, collaborative scenario.The tool works well in an online situation and would also be good in an in-person computer lab situation.In our final paper, the capstone course, we create a learning environment internal to the Developers Institute and with other partners where we get the learners to work on a project over eight weeks.We use constructivism in this project in the case of the Developers Institute, where it's a collaboration effort with our engineering team and a small group of students.The engineer from the Developers Institute will outline a project brief of more than half the elements the learners already know what to do.But the learners must research and learn about specific portions of the project to complete it.The engineer will be on hand to work with the group to give them the guidance they need when appropriate, but they are free to use new concepts and ideas to achieve the goal of completing the project brief.This uses the idea of Vygotsky’s zone of proximal development[^2], where the learner can do with the guidance of a knowledgeable other, in this case, the engineer from the Developers Institute.We combine the capstone course with the use of experiential learning theory as well.The learners are asked to complete the project and present their progress and findings with a fortnightly demonstration to staff and stakeholders at the Developers Institute.This is in conjunction with a portfolio assessment where they are asked to reflect on their learning and experience building out the project over the eight weeks.Both experiential learning and constructivism have some disadvantages, hence why we don't use them until the last project of a capstone, where we are focused on getting the learners to focus on how they can learn new concepts or technologies they haven't used before and how to apply them in context of a software solution.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"28GBYQmIfv8z2xSGdD8ah4vB4I0TJbB2KQWLsdk4Pzk="},"99ce079d-81ae-4270-b97b-5e6fee93dafb":{"id_":"99ce079d-81ae-4270-b97b-5e6fee93dafb","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/reflecting-practice-instructor.md","file_name":"reflecting-practice-instructor.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/reflecting-practice-instructor.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/reflecting-practice-instructor.md","file_name":"reflecting-practice-instructor.md","private":"false"},"hash":"147gTsCY2YVGn58PlXXRt6QZAQlLcnGarKoqrIcgsI8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ddc6e05a-ca44-4138-8d7d-fcb03b58c854","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/reflecting-practice-instructor.md","file_name":"reflecting-practice-instructor.md","private":"false"},"hash":"49rLvJZOCBKt/LxzLD3x7gVCK5jrrwNA9nKZjviggok="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"7500245f-638a-43bc-8934-c046105e1d01","metadata":{},"hash":"+am9RrTpwPMDZzcxKbJ2JWgiDUVQ2Oxf4AIYd/oikc0="}},"text":"Using them too early in the course would require too much core knowledge and would be totally reliant on the engineer (knowledgeable other) to help build the project.At the end of the course, they have covered all the core knowledge over previous terms and can quite easily make a small web app with authorisation and implement an API with database write and read functionality.Because the groups are relatively small, we can be more confident that all the students will have meaningful experiences concerning experiential learning.Also, with the learning experience happening outside of a traditional classroom setting, we negate constructionism's limitations where the learners can focus on the learning by doing.Finally, sustainability is something that we want to impart to our learners at Developer Institute.Sustainability can cover many things regarding education, but the two areas I'd like to highlight in my teaching practice are sustainable learning and the sustainability of the environment.Regarding education, we wish to make learning sustainable for our learners to succeed in their work lives in the fast-changing world of software development.What was once the current framework of choice this year could be out of favour the next.As our learners will experience many changes throughout their careers, finding relevant information on upcoming technologies is fundamental to being ready for this.This is a challenging task; unfortunately, we suggest recommended sources such as the W3C, the Mozilla developers network and how to find relevant information on programming languages.On top of those resources, it pays to form networking groups of your peers in both school alumni and other thought leaders in their fields, whether by social media, forums, or simply following trending libraries and frameworks on GitHub.The other aspect of sustainability we wish to encourage in our learners is the sustainability of the environment.One significant part of that is fundamental in how Developers Institute operates as a remote-only school.A high number of our learners, after graduating, look for remote-only jobs as that is how they feel most comfortable working after spending one or two years learning remotely.EECA attest[^3], \"Over 50% of New Zealand's energy-related emissions come from transport.Burning fossil fuels like petrol and diesel produces harmful emissions contributing to climate change\".If more people worked from home, they would not need to drive to an office, reducing emissions.Teaching software development remotely has been a challenging yet fulfilling experience for me.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"kqJx7km01RYD7Z8nggOySqMSLvE55LIfuttsKyUy7Tk="},"7500245f-638a-43bc-8934-c046105e1d01":{"id_":"7500245f-638a-43bc-8934-c046105e1d01","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/reflecting-practice-instructor.md","file_name":"reflecting-practice-instructor.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/reflecting-practice-instructor.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/reflecting-practice-instructor.md","file_name":"reflecting-practice-instructor.md","private":"false"},"hash":"147gTsCY2YVGn58PlXXRt6QZAQlLcnGarKoqrIcgsI8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"99ce079d-81ae-4270-b97b-5e6fee93dafb","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/reflecting-practice-instructor.md","file_name":"reflecting-practice-instructor.md","private":"false"},"hash":"KX0HlijjD1JUG6x6U/pqeM/7nm3RMygGew9Dv8gCM/E="}},"text":"Teaching

shop to be able to purchase via Stripes hosted checkout page.To do this we need to create a new API router to post the ID of the product we wish to purchase.In the `pages/api/` folder create a new file `checkout_sessions.js`.Add the following to this file:\n\n```js\nconst stripe = require(\"stripe\")(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);\n\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  if (req.method === \"POST\") {\n    try {\n      // Check priceId has been provided\n      if (!req.body?.priceId) {\n        throw new Error(\"Price ID not provided\");\n      }\n      // Create Checkout Sessions from body params.const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({\n        line_items: [\n          {\n            // Provide the exact Price ID (for example, pr_1234) of the product you want to sell\n            price: req.body.priceId,\n            quantity: 1,\n          },\n        ],\n        mode: \"payment\",\n        success_url: `${process.env.HOST}/success`,\n        cancel_url: `${process.env.HOST}/canceled`,\n      });\n      res.redirect(303, session.url);\n    } catch (err) {\n      res.status(err.statusCode || 500).json(err.message);\n    }\n  } else {\n    res.setHeader(\"Allow\", \"POST\");\n    res.status(405).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"6JrjnVwgsDUZSN0ubBPeWFkMuYxKxJuk+rWtdOmWJX8="},"d9f2d1b4-8e33-4cbb-ab2e-9f579e5f3ba9":{"id_":"d9f2d1b4-8e33-4cbb-ab2e-9f579e5f3ba9","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/shop-nextjs-stripe-checkout.md","file_name":"shop-nextjs-stripe-checkout.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/shop-nextjs-stripe-checkout.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/shop-nextjs-stripe-checkout.md","file_name":"shop-nextjs-stripe-checkout.md","private":"false"},"hash":"gj0hGZoY9UJ/VqDZzehAXD5e/5L0DWFMAg0AkkBcCzw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"036274e6-84f1-4c33-98bb-6fb5eb0976ea","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/shop-nextjs-stripe-checkout.md","file_name":"shop-nextjs-stripe-checkout.md","private":"false"},"hash":"6JrjnVwgsDUZSN0ubBPeWFkMuYxKxJuk+rWtdOmWJX8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"1efe80d0-e8b6-4a25-92a6-2963e34e86a5","metadata":{},"hash":"S54XF7Kl4eNYBQY7VLy9xoYi2FDMJ9AUHeysknR6/jg="}},"text":"setHeader(\"Allow\", \"POST\");\n    res.status(405).end(\"Method Not Allowed\");\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis function will only allow POST requests.It also checks to ensure that the request body contains the price ID for the product, before redirecting to Stripe requesting with our private Stripe key.In the previous step we have a form with a price ID value that we can post to this new `checkout_sessions.js` API route.On the product page we need to add the Stripe front-end library which generates a new shopping object.Let's first install via the terminal:\n\n```shell\nnpm install --save @stripe/stripe-js\n```\n\nOnce that's been added we can then add the following to the `index.js` file to create a Stripe object.Make sure it sits outside the component for the page.```js\n// import stripe js\nimport { loadStripe } from \"@stripe/stripe-js\";\n\n// Make sure to call `loadStripe` outside of a component’s render to avoid\n// recreating the `Stripe` object on every render.const stripePromise = loadStripe(\n  `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}`\n);\n```\n\nWe now need to create the following pages `success.js` and `canceled.js` to be added to the `pages` folder.The `success.js` file will have the following:\n\n```jsx\nimport Head from \"next/head\";\nimport Link from \"next/link\";\nimport { Layout } from \"../components/layout\";\n\nexport default function Success() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Head>\n        <title>Order Success</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Products\" />\n      </Head>\n      <Layout>\n        <h1>Order Success</h1>\n        <p>Thanks for ordering.</p>\n\n        <Link href=\"/\">Return to products</Link>\n      </Layout>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThe `canceled.js` will have the following:\n\n```jsx\nimport Head from \"next/head\";\nimport Link from \"next/link\";\nimport { Layout } from \"..","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"EZnQ+uponAp6ov5tjlpHolCIAVya5q5oxdzPM/I9sNs="},"1efe80d0-e8b6-4a25-92a6-2963e34e86a5":{"id_":"1efe80d0-e8b6-4a25-92a6-2963e34e86a5","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/shop-nextjs-stripe-checkout.md","file_name":"shop-nextjs-stripe-checkout.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/shop-nextjs-stripe-checkout.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/shop-nextjs-stripe-checkout.md","file_name":"shop-nextjs-stripe-checkout.md","private":"false"},"hash":"gj0hGZoY9UJ/VqDZzehAXD5e/5L0DWFMAg0AkkBcCzw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d9f2d1b4-8e33-4cbb-ab2e-9f579e5f3ba9","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/shop-nextjs-stripe-checkout.md","file_name":"shop-nextjs-stripe-checkout.md","private":"false"},"hash":"PlCBE0sBA0PSwmGcOeAF0Spzaj/1MQFlseDtRluS6r0="}},"text":"/components/layout\";\n\nexport

file we supply a `success_url` and a `canceled_url` value.This is where we redirect the user from the checkout page.When you click on the \"Buy Now\" button you will be redirected to the Stripe checkout, like in the image below.{% image \"./stripe-checkout.png\", \"The hosted Stripe checkout\" %}\n\nIf you complete the purchase, then you will be directed to the success page.{% image \"./order-success.png\", \"Successful order\" %}\n\nOtherwise if you click the left arrow / back you will be redirected to the cancel page.{% image \"./canceled-order.png\", \"Canceled order\" %}\n\nWe have now completed the display of products and have the checkout page working correctly.Well done.👏\n\nYou can checkout the GitHub repository for this project to see the finished result.Please note there are branches for each step.Alternatively you can view the repository on CodeSandbox.For more help with setting up Stripe checkout take a look at the documentation on the Stripe website.{% include \"promos/seriesstripenextjs.njk\"

shop series we now will display the products.\n\nWe first need to get the products from Stripe and we need to do that securely and not expose our secret Stripe key.\nSo let's start with creating a new file called `products.js` in the `/pages/api/` folder.\n\nWe need to install the **stripe** NPM package first. Run the following command to install it:\n\n```shell\nnpm install --save stripe\n```\n\nAdd the following to the `products.js` file:\n\n```js\nconst stripe = require(\"stripe\")(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);\n\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  try {\n    const products = await stripe.products.list({\n      limit: 100,\n    });\n\n    res.status(200).json(products);\n  } catch (err) {\n    res.status(500).json({ message: err.message });\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBy default the products can only be retrieved on the same origin ensuring that only our own shop can retrieve the products.\n\nLet's test our API retrieves our products when running locally. You should be able to see the JSON returned.\n\n{% image \"./product-api.png\", \"Response from the product API\" %}\n\nBefore we do anything else we need to create a _HOST_ environment variable. Open the `.env.local` file and add the following:\n\n```shell","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":1742,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"I0O6ZOzK7WXAJaWh9Ocg4GvtddzMKz7gUNWFEIqWCQY="},"e88976e9-3ae1-4ec2-ac7d-d892582d0ae1":{"id_":"e88976e9-3ae1-4ec2-ac7d-d892582d0ae1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md","file_name":"shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md_2","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md","file_name":"shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md","private":"false"},"hash":"6+bNdsvFI1tZhnqw6XzEuSp6MU7pq4ayd1JUpe380jM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d144a031-e17a-4b4c-a289-8c49d85c425c","metadata":{},"hash":"NbT1mzBQ63pAWwzx33E7PhukOE+J2DgPxpVD8wyEV28="}},"text":"# add HOST\nHOST=http://localhost:3000\n```\n\nWe will use the _HOST_ environment variable now, to prepend to our request to the API.Let's update the `index.js` file in the `pages` directory and add the following (outlined in the orange comments):\n\n```jsx\nimport Head from \"next/head\";\nimport { Layout } from \"../components/layout\";\n\n// Pass the products object to the Home page\nexport default function Home({ products }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Head>\n        <title>Products</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Products\" />\n      </Head>\n      <Layout>\n        {/* Need to pass products.data to the Products component */}\n        <Products products={products.data} />\n      </Layout>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n// Add getServerSideProps so we can return the data from server-side\nexport async function getServerSideProps() {\n  // Fetch data from external API\n  const res = await fetch(`${process.env.HOST}/api/products`);\n  const products = await res.json();\n\n  // Pass data to the page via props\n  return { props: { products } };\n}\n```\n\nThis will retrieve the products via a server side request so the page can pre-render.We now need a component to display this product information.To do this we will create a new javascript file called `products.js` in the `components` folder.```jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport Image from \"next/image\";\nimport styles from \"../styles/products.module.css\";\n\nexport const Products = ({ products }) => {\n  return (\n    <>\n      {/* Check that we have products */}\n

</>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nNotice in the above example we take advantage of the Next.js Image component.This component is great for displaying optimised versions of your images serving the correct sized image for the device/screen they are being served to.We also need to create a CSS module for the product component, create a new file called `products.module.css` in the `styles` folder.```css\n.link {\n  display: inline-block;\n  background-color: var(--primary-color);\n  color: #fff;\n  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;\n  border-radius: 0.2rem;\n  border: 1px solid var(--primary-color);\n}\n.link:hover {\n  background-color: #fff;\n  color: var(--primary-color);\n}\n.promotion {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: 1fr;\n  list-style: none;\n  gap: 1rem;\n  padding: 0;\n}\n@media screen and (min-width: 50rem) {\n  .promotion {\n    /* 2 columns */\n    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;\n  }\n}\n@media screen and (min-width: 70rem) {\n  .promotion {\n    /* 3 columns */\n    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe last step to get our images to display from Stripe is to update the `next.config.js` file with a parameter to allow us to retrieve the images from stripe.com.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"qG7Bhdi0T/YPwDadzplOEDawXwiul9IrOfWkw4fLwdM="},"5d33bf5d-fcd3-4037-bde5-f94dbe1516bd":{"id_":"5d33bf5d-fcd3-4037-bde5-f94dbe1516bd","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md","file_name":"shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md_2","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md","file_name":"shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md","private":"false"},"hash":"6+bNdsvFI1tZhnqw6XzEuSp6MU7pq4ayd1JUpe380jM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d144a031-e17a-4b4c-a289-8c49d85c425c","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md","file_name":"shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md","private":"false"},"hash":"NbT1mzBQ63pAWwzx33E7PhukOE+J2DgPxpVD8wyEV28="}},"text":"config.js`

the following:\n\n{% image \"./shop-with-products.png\", \"Products listed\" %}\n\nOur products are displaying now because we used `getServerSideProps` to retrieve the products server side.The product information is retrieved before rendering and served server side (information will be displayed even if JavaScript is disabled).Great for search engines to be able to index your products.Next, we will

\"promos/seriesstripenextjs.njk\" %}\n\nyoutube.com/embed/-3rN4US4xzo\n\nIn this series I'm going to walk through the process of building an online shop using the React Framework Next.js.You may have built a website before using the likes of Create React App which will get you the bare bones together to start building.But it doesn't get you that far before you have a huge amount of decisions to make.What routing should I use for my pages?What CSS in JS library?Should I use Tailwind?Will my website have good SEO?Very quickly you can be overloaded with decisions.This stems mostly from the fact that React is not a framework.It's a _library_.Next.js on the other hand is **\"The React Framework for Production\"**.With it a lot of the decisions have been made for you, letting you get up and running much faster.More importantly it solves a lot of the common problems that building a website/web app entail.You will need to have an understanding of HTML, CSS and React of course to follow along with this series.I teach all these subjects at Developers Institute where I'm a Tech Lead 😉\n\nTo get started building a Next.js application, hopefully you have Node installed ( if not download

will see 3 folders.The \"pages\" folder is where the routing happens.That will direct the url page in your app.For example if you had a file called `contact-us.js` to be routed to it you would have the following url your browser `http://localhost:3000/contact-us`. This will show the content from that component.Your **pages** folder will have a **api** folder and two files `_app.js` and `index.js`.Open the project in a browser and you should see something like this\n\n{% image \"./nextjs-start.png\", \"Next.JS Starter\" %}\n\nGreat the project is up and running in development mode 🙌\n\nIn your code editor (I suggest you use VS Code) we will open the `index.js` file in the `pages` folder.We are going to remove everything and replace it with the following:\n\n```jsx\nimport Head from \"next/head\";\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Head>\n        <title>Products</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Products\" />\n      </Head>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThat's cleared the standard install documentation links.Time to make our first component.Let's make a new folder called `components` and add a file `layout.js` in that directory.Add the following:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport Head from \"next/head\";\n\nimport styles from \"../styles/layout.module.css\";\n\nexport const Layout = ({ children }) => {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Head>\n        <link

will be the layout shared across all our pages in the shop.To add to that we will add a Header and a Footer component.Again in the `components` folder create a `header.js` and a `footer.js` file.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"AHJPenaOeLIm0xs+a6emrqJq9jbinNolNB1CR6npdwE="},"1bd3141a-fce8-48d9-b005-b51763d65c90":{"id_":"1bd3141a-fce8-48d9-b005-b51763d65c90","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/shop-nextjs-stripe-introduction.md","file_name":"shop-nextjs-stripe-introduction.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/shop-nextjs-stripe-introduction.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/shop-nextjs-stripe-introduction.md","file_name":"shop-nextjs-stripe-introduction.md","private":"false"},"hash":"uahXRWF88Vuojpne7BZcIS6NC3OCPggVmZCcn72+ur0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c471c26c-31d3-43da-9922-415518aeebf5","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/shop-nextjs-stripe-introduction.md","file_name":"shop-nextjs-stripe-introduction.md","private":"false"},"hash":"iwkfhJBpXeUTcmWOK2fnELtg2JNZQ8uiUThVzKZ34OI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"ab641283-ad0d-4078-9f9a-23cfc08d4aec","metadata":{},"hash":"XgcII1uPAWUcaJVT9GC7FHiUnRkDCnGoEYZJuNMkz5A="}},"text":"js` and a `footer.js` file.In the header file add the following:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\n\nexport const Header = () => {\n  return <header></header>;\n};\n```\n\nIn the footer file add the following:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\n\nexport const Footer = () => {\n  return <footer></footer>;\n};\n```\n\nWe need to update the layout component like so (see the comments in the code):\n\n```jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport Head from \"next/head\";\n\n// Add the following imports\nimport { Header } from \"./header\";\nimport { Footer } from \"./footer\";\n\nimport styles from \"../styles/layout.module.css\";\n\nexport const Layout = ({ children }) => {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Head>\n        <link rel=\"icon\" href=\"/favicon.ico\" />\n      </Head>\n      {/* Add the Header */}\n      <Header />\n      <div className={styles.container}>\n        <main className={styles.main}>{children}</main>\n      </div>\n      {/* Add the Footer */}\n      <Footer />\n    </>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nWe now have a Layout component we can re-use throughout our application with the Header and Footer on every page.We can pass the content for the page via the **children** prop.You may have noticed we have a reference to a CSS module but haven't added that to the `styles` folder yet.By default Next.js supports CSS modules, the major benefit with CSS modules is we can avoid CSS name collisions (it makes unique CSS class names) and feel comfortable to delete an unused CSS file as we know it's only relevant to one component.CSS Tricks has a series on CSS Modules worth reading to get a better understanding.Notice that the corresponding CSS classes above are referenced as a JavaScript object e.g.```jsx\n<div className={styles.container}>\n```\n\nLet's add the CSS and it's file.Create a `layout.module.css` file in the `styles` folder with the following code:\n\n```css\n.container {\n  min-height: 90vh;\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  justify-content: flex-start;\n}\n.main {\n  padding:

{\n  padding: 5.3rem 0 1rem 0;\n  margin: 0;\n  flex: 1;\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  align-items: center;\n}\n```\n\nNow we can add the Layout component to every page.Let's add it to the `index.js`:\n\n```js\nimport Head from \"next/head\";\nimport styles from \"../styles/Home.module.css\";\n\n// Import the layout components\nimport { Layout } from \"../components/layout\";\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Head>\n        <title>Products</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Products\" />\n      </Head>\n\n      {/* Add the Layout component to the Home page.*/}\n      <Layout></Layout>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nLet's start putting some content in to the Header component.Let's start off by adding some `<div>` tags to store a logo and some icons.```jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\n\nimport styles from \"../styles/header.module.css\";\n\nexport const Header = () => {\n  return (\n    <header className={styles.header}>\n      <div className={styles.mainNav}>\n        <div className={styles.iconNav}>\n          <nav></nav>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </header>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nAnd the subsequent CSS styles\n\n```css\n.header {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 4.4rem;\n  border-bottom: 1px solid #eaeaea;\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items:

`global.css` file with these variables.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"WIujOpNWkxevEUI5fYJhwznQ+4zzXJHjwtfJFxcNGk4="},"8fc07e64-6b4f-4572-878f-74aadea3caf8":{"id_":"8fc07e64-6b4f-4572-878f-74aadea3caf8","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/shop-nextjs-stripe-introduction.md","file_name":"shop-nextjs-stripe-introduction.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/shop-nextjs-stripe-introduction.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/shop-nextjs-stripe-introduction.md","file_name":"shop-nextjs-stripe-introduction.md","private":"false"},"hash":"uahXRWF88Vuojpne7BZcIS6NC3OCPggVmZCcn72+ur0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ab641283-ad0d-4078-9f9a-23cfc08d4aec","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/shop-nextjs-stripe-introduction.md","file_name":"shop-nextjs-stripe-introduction.md","private":"false"},"hash":"XgcII1uPAWUcaJVT9GC7FHiUnRkDCnGoEYZJuNMkz5A="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"17d5c5be-45f4-441b-a1eb-577c9935ed58","metadata":{},"hash":"0gCJoF6l9VLeBf9kP+e/BextDuI7UKCfb2RFZXXsHtw="}},"text":"css`

Machine Learning technology with the increase in the ability of Large Language Models at an almost frightening pace.Since late last year, we have seen huge jumps in the capability of generative AI art models to produce fantastic images from simple text prompts.We have seen all the GPT (Generative pre-trained transformer) tools like ChatGPT, for example, that given short text prompts can produce answers for simple facts to writing history essays.What’s even more exciting is the adoption of the technology companies adding these capabilities to products we already use and love.AI answers have now been incorporated into searches on Bing and Google, so your answers are provided directly in the search engine itself.Adobe has added generative image creation into Photoshop to create extraordinary images with text prompts.Canva can produce multiple templates on the fly from a user uploading an image and some colour prompts.We have benefitted significantly at Developers Institute

like learners would have previously learnt how to use a search engine like Google, they will be taught how to interact with ChatGPT and what prompts can elicit different responses.While ChatGPT is a valuable tool, we will also have to remind our learners that it is an early technology tool and not infallible, it still has issues with “hallucinations” of facts that are entirely fabricated, a concept popularised by Google AI researchers (Agarwal et al., 2018)[^2].Learners must verify answers with reliable sources, official documentation, or via our learner support team.GitHub Copilot is a plugin for Visual Studio Code, the IDE (integrated development environment) we use at the Developers Institute.It is an extension of a developer's work environment and acts as an AI pair programmer that helps one write code.It does this by prompting suggested code based on the context of your existing code and interpreting code comments.It will show this suggested code in the grey text beside the cursor.If it seems satisfactory, pressing the tab key will embed this suggestion into your code base.The suggestions can be from a simple line to multiple lines, depending on what the AI model predicts you will use.It will also suggest multiple options, generally more than one.If unhappy, use the “Next\" suggestion keyboard shortcut.The predictions/suggestions will even use the declared variables in your existing code.{% figure \"./vscode-copilot.png\", \"Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot\" %}\n\nThe benefits that most developers find when using Copilot are the following:\n\n- Productivity increased: Copilot can improve productivity by providing context-relevant code suggestions when needed.Stopping a developer from needing to switch contexts and having to look up documentation (Peng et al., 2023)[^3].- Generating tests: When writing code for software development, it is best practice to write tests to ensure your code is working correctly.Often this can be a mind-numbing task doing simple checks to ensure that when two known values are passed to a function, the expected results are always the same every time the function is run.You can ensure this is the case by writing tests (small pieces of code to check) that test the boundaries of happy and negative paths.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"pJRVE4pSz+ztMnTOH+RdC/efzR+XEhNhjlzxNew2ABU="},"13f78b3b-55ac-4c3b-a146-164eb311187d":{"id_":"13f78b3b-55ac-4c3b-a146-164eb311187d","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/teaching-software-development-with-ai.md","file_name":"teaching-software-development-with-ai.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/teaching-software-development-with-ai.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/teaching-software-development-with-ai.md","file_name":"teaching-software-development-with-ai.md","private":"false"},"hash":"ABaUDJcKPZPqpOYhHBanUYhj9QQ/o/ioqylUNof/PPA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"72f8819e-e3f7-4713-b4d3-b9f1e4309268","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/teaching-software-development-with-ai.md","file_name":"teaching-software-development-with-ai.md","private":"false"},"hash":"Y/MqOZVYsv9nDCDMOktuDOMYFzfum42uaWUITLBJblc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"7f5b00a5-7d9b-4ab9-9293-bc125f43fcf7","metadata":{},"hash":"YiLLVtEEyprV2XphJn8j3HMC+mEmutd/NWZKpn529ig="}},"text":"Copilot

Development with AI\", which we plan to be 2-3 weeks of content and can be completed after our first program in the student's software development journey as a supplementary self-paced online course.That way, existing students and new learners alike can up-skill.Another great tool that enables collaborative learning between students and teaching staff is GitHub Codespaces.It is a cloud-based development environment.It allows you to code as if using Visual Studio Code, in the cloud via a browser (or your local copy of VS Code).There is no need to set up a local environment to install Node.js or Python (or whatever language you require) and necessary dependencies etc.\n\n{% figure \"./vscode-codespaces.png\", \"Visual Studio Code using Codespaces\" %}\n\nSome of the benefits of Codespaces are the following (Malan, 2022)[^5]:\n\n- Consistent and accessible coding environment: Regardless of the computing device, it's possible to code on complicated multiple-tier applications from an iPad or Chromebook as the code runs in the cloud.- Rapid onboarding and sharing: Students and staff can quickly set up and start working on a shared project or exercise in a class without the hassle of setting up a local development environment.The Codespaces can be configured with all tools and dependencies near instantly.- Collaboration and code review: It's common to support our learners by needing to run their exercise or project to help them debug.We must find their Git repository, clone it locally to our local development environment (computer), and install all the dependencies to provide support.With Codespaces, we can quickly deploy in the cloud and share the same code in seconds.In the long term, we plan to migrate our existing exercises and projects to use development containers config files to take advantage of Codespaces, locally or in the

systems on our environment by reducing energy consumption and using green energy, reducing carbon emissions.There are several ways to do this:\n\n- Green (Cloud) Hosting: Choosing environmentally friendly hosting options.For example, Microsoft is powering their data centres with carbon-zero power and has just signed a 10-year power purchase agreement with Contact Energy to supply geothermal energy (NZX, 2023)[^6].- Energy efficiency and optimisation: Teach energy-efficient programming practices and techniques where resources are minimised, and we attempt to reduce unnecessary compute time.Thus reducing the energy consumption of servers (Abhishek et al., 2021)[^7].- Promote reduced cost: By optimising efficiency, the software can require smaller servers to reduce the cost of hosting.The reduced cost benefit is an easy sell to employers.If each graduate can help make environmentally sustainable efforts for software development in Aotearoa more common, we can get a little closer to our reduction of greenhouse gas emissions goals of 2030, and reduce the impact of climate change.In conclusion, as a remote school heavily relying on technology, it's important to continue innovating in education to enhance the student's learning experience.We need to educate students in tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to assist and support them when practising to become software developers.Allowing collaboration and learning to be more accessible to staff and learners by easily sharing their current issue(s) without frustration and hassle using Codespaces.We need them to go

what Tailwind CSS is, and its pros & cons.socialBackground: bg2\nogimage: \"TailwindFlexboxCover.jpg\"\n---\n\nTailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that can provide many benefits for a web development project.It lets you style your HTML content by appending a multitude of predefined utility CSS classes to your HTML elements.For example say you were creating a Card component with a heading, description and image using ReactJS.```jsx\nconst Card = ({ heading, description, image }) => {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"cardContainer\">\n      <img src={image} className=\"cardImage\" alt=\"\" />\n      <div>\n        <h3 className=\"cardHeading\">{heading}</h3>\n        <div className=\"cardDescription\">{description}</div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nUsing standard CSS we would create classes for all the elements in our Card component like the example above.This would require us to create these individual classes in a CSS file.In this scenario there are two things that need to be done:\n\n1.Name our CSS class names: Naming can be difficult, especially when multiple team members are involved.It can lead to confusion, for example, if one person refers to a component as a \"tile\" and another calls it a \"card.\"2.Duplication: Repeating the same CSS properties multiple times throughout the CSS file(s) e.g.`margin: 0` and `padding: 1rem` we can end up with a mess that most developers on your team would be afraid to change for fear of regression issues.```css\n.cardContainer {\n  border-radius: 0.75rem;\n  display: flex;\n  gap: 0.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"E9Phx0mQfu7QqSxZoha1yXehbbI7yi84ckPYhmCHA2k="},"e47a5bb3-6399-4b98-b313-b87096ed3e60":{"id_":"e47a5bb3-6399-4b98-b313-b87096ed3e60","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/what-is-tailwind-css.md","file_name":"what-is-tailwind-css.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/what-is-tailwind-css.md_1","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/what-is-tailwind-css.md","file_name":"what-is-tailwind-css.md","private":"false"},"hash":"grIa3gLFGgkPfZPirj5E0XLfe4U7MOiagXeQF13eD40="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1ba88bde-0cb3-441f-aacf-85048796f4e9","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/what-is-tailwind-css.md","file_name":"what-is-tailwind-css.md","private":"false"},"hash":"E9Phx0mQfu7QqSxZoha1yXehbbI7yi84ckPYhmCHA2k="}},"text":"75rem;\n

rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1);\n}\n.cardHeading {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n```\n\nCompare this to the same component but this time using CSS classes from Tailwind CSS below.Initially it's a shock to see such a mess of CSS classes for each HTML element.But each class is easy to remember as they map to existing CSS properties, and will not be repeated in the CSS file.```jsx\nconst Card = ({ heading, description, image }) => {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"rounded-xl shadow-lg bg-white p-4 mb-4 flex gap-2\">\n      <img src={image} className=\"rounded-lg\" alt=\"\" />\n      <div>\n        <h3

Why should I use Tailwind CSS?\n\nSo why would you use Tailwind and pollute your components with all these class names?\n\nThe most common answer to why is you don't have to worry about naming classes or naming collisions in your CSS. Instead you can just get on with using the CSS properties you already know and set about applying them to your HTML elements. You don't even need to view the CSS file. You can just remain working on the component with the occasional look at the Tailwind documentation.\n\nSome more reasons to use Tailwind CSS are:\n\n- DRY: No repetition of code in your CSS files, `margin-left: 1rem` is only declared once in your stylesheet. CSS property declarations are DRY so aren't repeated\n- Lack of confusion: No confusion of naming as all members of the team use the pre-existing CSS class names instead of creating new CSS classes\n- Speed: Tailwind CSS provides pre-defined CSS classes that can be used to quickly style elements, allowing developers to focus on building the structure and functionality of their website or application.\n- Consistency: By using the same pre-defined classes throughout the project, developers can ensure that the design is consistent across all pages and components.\n- Customization: Tailwind CSS allows developers to customize the default styles and generate new classes with specific variations, giving more flexibility and control over the design.\n- Accessibility: Tailwind CSS provides a set of utility classes to help implement accessibility best practices, such as providing sufficient contrast and using semantic HTML elements.\n- Performance: Tailwind CSS allows you to only include the CSS you need (via a clever build process), leading to smaller CSS file sizes and faster load times for your website or application.","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":2,"endCharIdx":1782,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"tetiq48vqVLosEL43SKB9/NTjIrXZ3zsGMsXYDhaWj4="},"10defc2c-2043-45c5-a3be-712dc25111df":{"id_":"10defc2c-2043-45c5-a3be-712dc25111df","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/what-is-tailwind-css.md","file_name":"what-is-tailwind-css.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/what-is-tailwind-css.md_3","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/what-is-tailwind-css.md","file_name":"what-is-tailwind-css.md","private":"false"},"hash":"SoOqUAyn4BB/HTyI8fIKSgL4Tx7EgDcbklvo3Lq57W8="}},"text":"## What makes the Tailwind CSS developer experience (DX) good?\n\nIn terms of developer experience once you get over it looking like horrible **tag soup** with all those CSS classes scattered through your HTML/JSX files you will start to notice a couple of things:\n\n- Tailwind CSS is ideal in team situations. By default, you don't have naming conflicts and there are no confusion about names as styling is done at the property level.\n- The use of the Tailwind Labs official plugin for VS Code enable autocomplete functionality. If you already know the name of CSS properties and have used the likes of Bootstrap for padding and margin you will quickly feel familiar with Tailwind.\n- Another benefit is that you aren't changing the CSS, instead you are working on the HTML so there is little chance of breaking styling for other parts of your website.\n- You will only have to do a minimal amount of CSS work for the likes of theming or specific custom styles which means your CSS won't grow in size much at all. In fact with the build process your HTML can be scanned to look for the CSS classes and determine if they are not used and can be removed from the CSS file of the website. Therefore only creating a CSS file with the CSS classes used.\n- As the padding and margin values are predefined you won't get the same padding value declared multiple times scattered through your CSS file. You can also check at a glance are elements sharing the same padding or margin by the CSS classes applied without having to use the browser dev tools or find the class in the CSS.\n- No need to write media queries as instead you can use the utility classes outlined here in the vein of `md:w-32` to only apply the CSS class on the page being **medium** sized.","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":2,"endCharIdx":1748,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"pYyplEDzUibxt51Ghx9xEJWOdsFQfzqWkoFXU1LbohM="},"be7d5a5c-dfaf-4cb5-a05d-8d3095cec746":{"id_":"be7d5a5c-dfaf-4cb5-a05d-8d3095cec746","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/what-is-tailwind-css.md","file_name":"what-is-tailwind-css.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/what-is-tailwind-css.md_4","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/what-is-tailwind-css.md","file_name":"what-is-tailwind-css.md","private":"false"},"hash":"6AyVAsif1slAFizsovxiws5+Jgf9UnOdHWd2mz1sMnY="}},"text":"## When should I use Tailwind CSS?\n\nBased on my experience, Tailwind CSS is most effective when used on a team where some or most of the developers have limited CSS skills.

What are the downsides of Tailwind CSS?Although Tailwind CSS offers many benefits, there are some drawbacks that could affect both the short-term and long-term success of your project:\n\n- File size: Tailwind requires a large number of CSS classes to be added to your HTML, which can lead to longer page load times and larger file sizes if not optimized properly.- Learning curve: Tailwind CSS requires a different approach to writing CSS, which can take some time to learn and adjust to.- Opinionated design: Tailwind CSS provides pre-defined classes that can be used to quickly style elements, but it also imposes a specific design aesthetic that may not align with the desired look and feel of the website or application.- Overuse of classes: Using too many classes on a single element can make the HTML difficult to read and understand, leading to a more complex and harder to maintain codebase.- Customization: Tailwind CSS is highly customizable, but this can also lead to increased complexity in terms of configuration, and can make it harder to maintain the design consistency across the project.- Hard to remove: It can be challenging to remove Tailwind CSS once it has been implemented.This is because the embedded Tailwind classes are present throughout your HTML, component, or template files, and removing them incrementally can create conflicts with the Tailwind build system.Additionally, it may further complicate the project by requiring an additional build process for the new setup to incrementally replace styling.- Waiting on bleeding edge CSS features: Recent years have seen significant advancements in browser CSS capabilities, such as Container Queries, `:has()`, and Subgrid.While these features can enhance the design and functionality of a website, they can be difficult to implement using Tailwind.In some cases, it may be necessary to wait for them to become available in Tailwind or make changes to the implementation once they are supported.- Native is forever: When incorporating a new framework like Tailwind into a project, it will require a learning phase.However, it's important to note that the knowledge acquired is specific to the Tailwind framework, including its class names and naming conventions, which may not be transferable to other frameworks.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"qRgyJ/Yuu/d+aC1OZg2hOf7hOWMdeDpjpLxVDzT0JVg="},"c627720e-e3f3-431d-b272-28623a878e87":{"id_":"c627720e-e3f3-431d-b272-28623a878e87","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/what-is-tailwind-css.md","file_name":"what-is-tailwind-css.md","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/what-is-tailwind-css.md_5","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/what-is-tailwind-css.md","file_name":"what-is-tailwind-css.md","private":"false"},"hash":"pY8O9dmGvmY4sOjktj2srQVlz0tQQvQJOj8O6aEvwd8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a8f722a5-859b-4ed5-b030-b95e127410b3","metadata":{"file_path":"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/what-is-tailwind-css.md","file_name":"what-is-tailwind-css.md","private":"false"},"hash":"qRgyJ/Yuu/d+aC1OZg2hOf7hOWMdeDpjpLxVDzT0JVg="}},"text":"On the other hand, using CSS in its native form and understanding its intended use will result in a knowledge that will remain useful for a long time.- Bare-bones by default: What makes Tailwind different to other frameworks like Bootstrap etc is that you will need to create basic components like footers and headers from scratch, unless you pay for TailwindUI.These prebuilt components are not freely available as open source.Instead most build there own components from scratch using the Tailwind CSS classes.Tailwind can be a suitable choice for almost any team, especially those that have no strong lead in CSS.Although it has some drawbacks, it sits between Bootstrap and native CSS in terms of flexibility and appearance.It avoids the common \"look and feel\" of websites built with Bootstrap, while providing some rails to prevent a large messy CSS file.To get the most out of Tailwind, it is important to adhere to its recommended practices and adjust your process to it's way.If this hasn't put you off using Tailwind CSS in your next project I recommend you checking out the Freecodecamp Learn Tailwind CSS - Course for Beginners and my cheat-sheet below.{% include
