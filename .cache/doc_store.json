To test that the function returns the correct output for multiple numbers, you could write the following test:\\n\\n```javascript\\ntest(\\\"returns an array with the correct output for multiple numbers\\\";, () => {\\n  expect(getFizzBuzz([1, 2, 3])).toStrictEqual([1, 2, \\\"Fizz\\\"]);\\n});\\n\\n```\\n\\n> 1. Finally, you can run your tests using the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm test\\n```\\n\\n> This will run all of your tests and print any failures to the console. If all of your tests pass, you can be confident that your `getFizzBuzz` function is working correctly.[/INST] Sure! Here are some possible reasons why your code might not be working as expected:\\n\\n> 1. Syntax errors: There could be syntax errors in your code that are preventing it from running correctly. Check your code for any syntax errors by running the command `npm run lint` or `npm run lint --fix`.\\n> 2. Dependency issues: Your code might be depending on certain packages or libraries that are not installed correctly. Check if all of the dependencies in your `package.json` file are installed correctly by running the command `npm install`.\\n> 3. Environmental issues: There could be environmental issues such as a lack of memory or CPU resources that are preventing your code from running correctly. Try restarting your computer or adjusting your system settings to see if that resolves the issue.\\n> 4. Code logic errors: Your code might have logical errors that are preventing it from producing the expected output. Check your code for any logical errors by stepping through it with a debugger or by adding console logs to print out important values at different points in your code.\\n\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"v4zd/SVhGJ9FMjnM6kZnZ1MbUYcTnynQ4FXP0EAprLc=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/ai-assisted-coding-tools-codellama-vs-github-copilot-chat.md_17":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/ai-assisted-coding-tools-codellama-vs-github-copilot-chat.md_17\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/ai-assisted-coding-tools-codellama-vs-github-copilot-chat.md\",\"file_name\":\"ai-assisted-coding-tools-codellama-vs-github-copilot-chat.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn my opinion GitHub Copilot Chat is still the better tool to use, and combined with the fact you also get autocomplete while you code.

If you haven't heard of Eleventy also known as 11ty it's a fast Static Site Generator (SSG) that uses NodeS. It converts in my case Markdown files into a fast, easy to maintain blog that I've used since Jan 2021. As per usual upgrading to it was easy. So what's new?\\n\\n- ESM (ECMAScript Modules) support - so now you can use `import` and `export` in your templates!\\n- It's smaller, has fewer dependencies, and is faster to install.\\n- Plus a whole lot of other goodies\\n\\nThe upgrade plugin makes it super easy to upgrade. First up I wanted to take advantage of ESM syntax. I renamed my `eleventy.config.js` to `eleventy.config.mjs`. Installed the helper plugin by running:\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm install @11ty/eleventy-upgrade-help@3\\n```\\n\\nAdded the upgrade plugin to the `eleventy.config.mjs` file.\\nCommit here\\n\\n```js\\nimport UpgradeHelper from \\\"@11ty/eleventy-upgrade-help\\\";\\n\\n// Added the upgrade helper plugin  inside the default function\\neleventyConfig.addPlugin(UpgradeHelper);\\n```\\n\\nAsked GitHub Copilot to \\\"Update to esm syntax\\\" and made sure the `eleventy.config.mjs` file was referenced in the chat. That converted all my `require` statements into `import` statements.\\n\\nSee the difference here between my previous v2 config to my v3 config.\\n\\n{% highlight \\\"diff-js\\\" %}\\n// v2 require statements\\n-const { DateTime } = require(\\\"luxon\\\");\\n-const markdownItAnchor = require(\\\"markdown-it-anchor\\\");\\n-const markdownIt = require(\\\"markdown-it\\\");\\n\\n-const pluginRss = require(\\\"@11ty/eleventy-plugin-rss\\\");\\n-const pluginSyntaxHighlight = require(\\\"@11ty/eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight\\\");\\n-const pluginBundle = require(\\\"@11ty/eleventy-plugin-bundle\\\");\\n-const pluginNavigation = require(\\\"@11ty/eleventy-navigation\\\");\\n-const { EleventyHtmlBasePlugin } = require(\\\"@11ty/eleventy\\\");\\n\\n-const pluginDrafts = require(\\\"./eleventy.config.drafts.js\\\");\\n-const pluginImages = require(\\\"./eleventy.config.images.js\\\");\\n-const embedYouTube = require(\\\"eleventy-plugin-youtube-embed\\\");\\n\\n// v3 import statements\\n+import { DateTime } from \\\"luxon\\\";\\n+import markdownItAnchor from \\\"markdown-it-anchor\\\";\\n+import markdownIt from \\\"markdown-it\\\";\\n\\n+import pluginRss from \\\"@11ty/eleventy-plugin-rss\\\";\\n+import pluginSyntaxHighlight from \\\"@11ty/eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight\\\";\\n+import pluginBundle from \\\"@11ty/eleventy-plugin-bundle\\\";\\n+import pluginNavigation from \\\"@11ty/eleventy-navigation\\\";\\n+import { EleventyHtmlBasePlugin } from \\\"@11ty/eleventy\\\";\\n\\n+import pluginDrafts from \\\"./eleventy.config.drafts.js\\\";\\n+import pluginImages from \\\"./eleventy.config.images.js\\\";\\n+import embedYouTube from \\\"eleventy-plugin-youtube-embed\\\";\\n{% endhighlight %}\\n\\nThen it was time to test everything was working. Sure enough everything worked as expected. I removed the upgrade helper plugin and did a little tidy up switching syntax from commonjs to esm (es6/es2015) and pushed the branch to test the preview build (got to love Netlify's setup). The preview build looked good too, so I merged it into main. All done and dusted in under an hour. This is how all upgrades should work.\\n\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"0m5UuZ4S/qazM+QqBb8CWBF2Oc+EphqRQtvyBpEQ4Tg=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md_1":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md_1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md\",\"file_name\":\"build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"---\\ntitle: Build a Full-Stack web app with Next.js - Part 4 - DB Design\\ndate: \\\"2023-10-13T15:45:33Z\\\"\\ntemplate: post\\ndraft: false\\nslug: \\\"build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design\\\"\\ncategory: article\\ntags:\\n  - db\\n  - database\\n  - design\\n  - dbdiagram.io\\n  - next.js\\n  - ERD\\ndescription: \\\"In this video, we will be designing the database for our app. We will be using dbdiagram.io to design our database.

This is part 4 of the series. In this video, I started the design of the database for our app. I used dbdiagram.io to design our database, using DBML and denoted the relation ships between tables. Using the export option I quickly created the tables in our ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) on Supabase.\\n\\nThe project is available on GitHub as LMS NextJS.\\n\\nDB diagram available on dbdiagram.io.\\n\\nyoutube.com/embed/4uPQxMDKSUU\\n\\n---\\n\\nOkay, looks like we're live.\\n\\nOkay, all right.\\n\\nOkay, hi there.\\n\\nI'm Andrew, by the way, for those who don't know me, and I've been running this series on building a full stack web app with with Next.js.\\n\\nAnd so the whole idea is to make an app from scratch using Next.js.\\n\\nWe're going to use Superbase for the database, and we're going to go through the whole planning process and getting everything ready together, and go over some of the theory, of course, of why we should do things the way I am showing you.\\n\\nOf course, open to suggestions, not the VLN handle.\\n\\nThis is just one way to do it.\\n\\nSo let's just jump into it, I think.\\n\\nSo today's stream is going to be working on the design of a database.\\n\\nSo not actually building it as such in any code or anything like that.\\n\\ngoing to use a tool called DB diagram and we're going to use that to help us design the database that we're going to put together for our LMS and we have a super base.\\n\\nOkay let's jump straight into that.\\n\\nSo they're going to be pretty much sitting in Chrome for this whole demo.\\n\\nAnd I've gone here to DB diagram right here.\\n\\nSo you can use this so free tool.\\n\\nI've used this many times in the past.\\n\\nI'm sure many of my past students remember going through using this.\\n\\nBut it basically allows you to draw entity relationship diagrams in a nice little web tool and we'll just start getting into it I think.\\n\\nSo let's sort of think back and sort of cast our minds back to what we've done previously.\\n\\nSo we have created a table for Superbase and it's sitting here in the Table Editor and we've got a courses table.\\n\\nOK, so this is basically a table that we started last stream, which was about two weeks ago now.\\n\\nAnd in it we have a name and a description and an image for the course.\\n\\nand we can ID.\\n\\nSo we can use that as one of the part of the design that we're going to be working on.\\n\\nSo let's jump straight to DPDiagram and sort of get our heads in the game about how we're going to design this database.\\n\\nOkay so it's got a pretty simple format, you log in, you can use github login which is handy of course not having to create another account again and it's got like a basic demo here and it's talking about a product category and a product image and it's a nice sort of starting block there and it shows sort of the relationship here between these three tables So these are not the tables that we're going to use, but this is a good place to start so that we can sort of see how the tool works.\\n\\nSo the tool is very much a.\\n\\nit's a representation of the database's tables and those relationships between them.\\n\\nIt has the keys, it has the IDs, it has the different types of the data restorative and it's all represented in a nice clean easy to sort of follow tool.\\n\\nSo let's clear this out so that we're starting from scratch.\\n\\nOkay so once I do that it's now got no tables in there.\\n\\nOkay and so we've got the courses table which is what I was showing before.\\n\\nSo we can have a table, you don't need to know so much the syntax for this, it does have a bit of help here in the documentation.\\n\\nbut you can get along pretty far just by sort of following the examples.\\n\\nOkay so give it a table name.\\n\\nSo this isn't SQL as such, it's just a language that's used for the dp-diagram.\\n\\nio.\\n\\nI'm trying to remember what it is off the top of my head.\\n\\nI think it's DBML.\\n\\nYes, DBML is a syntax for defining a database.\\n\\nSo, Open Source Markout Language User Defined Database Schema Structure.\\n\\nDBML is also developed by the team behind DB diagram.\\n\\nSo, all the help's in here.\\n\\nIt's got the actual outline there of a basic table structure and how to do this relationship of some of the next page there.\\n\\nSo let's go back to our diagram.\\n\\nSo we've got a table, we've got courses.\\n\\nNext one I was showing before in the UI for Superbase.\\n\\nAgain it's a very sort of simple sort of markup kind of language.\\n\\nSo you've got the table name using a plural there for courses.\\n\\nAnd I need to have an ID.\\n\\nSo I'm going to have a course ID.\\n\\nThis is going to be a integer.\\n\\nSo let's make sure that we do that the correct way.\\n\\nSo it's an integer like that, int.\\n\\nAnd we can have the primary key there.\\n\\nThat's what the PK stands for.\\n\\nSo if we go like that.\\n\\nOK, it's got a little key icon there for the cross ID.\\n\\nSo that's very much like what we've got for our existing table here.\\n\\nSo the next field in there is a created at.\\n\\nAgain, created it and this is going to be a timestamp.\\n\\nI believe that's the right type.\\n\\nSo timestamp, whenever a row is added to this table, it's going to get the timestamp placed on it and so that we know when that record was actually created.\\n\\nOkay so we then got back to let's have a double check again we've got the name of archer and the description a text okay so again name so this is the name of the course.\\n\\nName is a reserved word you can use use that word in this context so I could actually just just change it to a course name.\\n\\nThat actually might be a better descriptive name of it and it's gonna stop any sort of confusion there.\\n\\nWe're gonna know when it's a name and it says course_name that it is of the course table.\\n\\nAnd we can give it a varchar like so.\\n\\nOkay so we've got the course ID created at course name and the Vacha.\\n\\nI'm gonna have a description.\\n\\nOkay so this is description for our course.\\n\\nOkay I'm gonna use the text type here because I expect this to be more like a paragraph of content.\\n\\nWith Vacha it's I guess more for a limited name.\\n\\nIdeally, it's sort of, our child will probably store less bytes in their records.\\n\\nNot that that's such a big issue these days in the past.\\n\\nThat is something that people would stress about because, wow, RAM was expensive and so was this space.\\n\\nSo thankfully, that has changed from there.\\n\\nAnd so we can have a image as well and this is going to be a VARCHA and it's going to point to some sort of hosting that we will talk about at a latest point.\\n\\nBut for the time being it's just going to be a VARCHA.\\n\\nIt could be an actual direct link to where the image is actually located.\\n\\nOkay, all right so that's going to have our ID for the course, the created app, course name, description and the image there.\\n\\nOkay, so we've got one table and that courses table, I mean it's a key part of our LMS.\\n\\nYou need to have a course to be able to learn from, So it's really important that we have this table as part of our MVP.\\n\\nSo let's continue on.\\n\\nI know we need, with anything with a course, you could have maybe a course section.\\n\\nSo you've got the course itself but you need the actual content for each part of it.\\n\\nSo what we can do now is a table again for the courses section.\\n\\nSo courses section.\\n\\nLike that.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nAnd so this courses section is going to need a ID.\\n\\nSo we can have a section ID, integer again, primary key, like so.\\n\\nAnd we can do the most important part about it is that we can have a relationship there for the courses to the courses section.\\n\\nSo we can have the course ID as an int.\\n\\nAnd we're also going to need, I guess, something to go into our courses section.\\n\\nSo we'll have-- what we could really have.\\n\\nSo a section could be maybe it's some text, it could be just a sort of a free-form text area.\\n\\nSo we could have section itself and the content.\\n\\nOK, so say I see like a section would be like a page in the course.\\n\\nSo we can give it a title.\\n\\nTitle would probably be good.\\n\\nSomething like that.\\n\\nVacher will have the course itself and we'll have a section of where it is and we'll also need probably something they probably haven't thought about is something like an order.\\n\\nSo we're going to have the order for the section.\\n\\nSo what do I mean by that?\\n\\nSo imagine you've got a book and the book would be a course and in that course you'd have the book and it would have in it it would have pages and each page could have like a title, it could have the order so like which page it's on so this could be the order so one to you know 100, 150, 300 whatever how many pages your course is going to be.\\n\\nSo by having an order there we can shuffle stuff around if we want want to at a later date, which is going to be handy for people administrating the course.\\n\\nSo they're going to need to have some way of being able to order that section.\\n\\nSo imagine we've got the courses page.\\n\\nThey're going to have a landing page for that course.\\n\\nThey go into the course.\\n\\nThey go to the first page.\\n\\nAnd it would be the one that would have the first item by order.\\n\\nSo it would be the first order there.\\n\\nAnd then it would display the title, hopefully.\\n\\nAnd we'll just leave, I think, that section at that.\\n\\nBecause we're going to do the next part in my table structure.\\n\\nSo I'm going to have-- I've got a courses.\\n\\nI've got a courses section.\\n\\nI'm going to have a courses media.\\n\\nOK.\\n\\nOK, so this is going to be, I guess, the actual content itself that sits inside a section.\\n\\nOK, so it's going to have a media ID.\\n\\nThis is getting, I guess, relatively complex pretty quickly.\\n\\nThis is why we're doing it as a diagram so that we can get it clearly in our head about what we're actually trying to do.\\n\\nSo we're going to have the Media ID, the section ID, and we're going to have the Course ID.\\n\\nNo, we don't need the Course ID, do we?\\n\\nWhy do we not need the Course ID?\\n\\nBecause we've already got the Course ID in the section, so if the courses media is linked to the section there, then we should be fine.\\n\\nOkay, so I've got the Media ID, Section ID, and then I'm going to have an image.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nAnd.\\n\\nI'm actually not going to do that.\\n\\nI'm going to do the actual section content.\\n\\nSo this will be the content.\\n\\nI'm just going to have it as a text area.\\n\\nThinking I'm going to use sort of markdown for this, but I'm still in the early stages of planning out the app.\\n\\nAnd that's OK.\\n\\nWe can change it later.\\n\\nThis is the first part of our planning.\\n\\nWe don't have to get too caught up on the details too far yet.\\n\\nOK.\\n\\nSo you can auto-arrange that, so just that, oh, I've got them in the middle there.\\n\\nThat auto-arrange, all the tables there for us.\\n\\nSo it's starting to get that sort of visual look and feel so we can actually start getting an idea of how this is actually going to work for us.\\n\\nOK, so we've got the courses, the courses section, the courses media.\\n\\nalso going to need some comments I believe.\\n\\nSo what we can do is we can have that again another table and we can have our courses.\\n\\nThis is going to be the comments table.\\n\\nOkay, so we've got this courses comments.\\n\\nWe need to link, we're going to link the comments to the media, and the media is going to be linked to the section, and the section is going to be linked to the course row.\\n\\nOkay, so we've got the courses comments.\\n\\nSo I'm going to have 'comment ID', again, another primary key, like so.\\n\\nAnd we are going to have the student.\\n\\nSo I'm going to put the student ID in.\\n\\nAnd I'm going to put the comment itself.\\n\\nOkay, so we're going to do a basic structure here now for our courses.\\n\\nWe talked about that we want students to be able to enroll into these courses.\\n\\nSo we need to also probably have some way of recording how that's done.\\n\\nThere's a couple of different ways we can do that.\\n\\nWe'll come back to that because I think it's probably important now that we start showing some of these relationships between these four tables so that we get an understanding of how this data is all going to be tied together.\\n\\nAnd this is the biggest reason why we use the entity relationship diagram.\\n\\nIt just makes it easier for us to understand what the relationships are between the different tables there.\\n\\nIt's got a really basic sort of structure here.\\n\\nSo you've actually got two ways to do this according to the docs here.\\n\\nSo you can do your relationship like so with the ref there pointing to the other table.\\n\\nOr you can use for the likes of a many to one relationship.\\n\\nyou can do the same of having it in line instead and you can see here it's very similar syntax, it's just that it's got a square brackets around that.\\n\\nOkay so let's grab this one, we don't really need the first part of it but basically we have, we're going to have a very much a one-to-many.\\n\\nSo let's think about this.\\n\\nLet's look at this diagram and get a sort of head around this.\\n\\nSo it's saying we've got a many-to-one relationship.\\n\\nOkay so in the code here it's got a reference here, many-to-one like so.\\n\\nOkay so we could have the same.\\n\\nSo we could have our course ID like so.\\n\\nAnd so there's a couple of two different ways that you can see that I've done this.\\n\\nSo now it's representing that sort of link between the two.\\n\\nSo I've just dragged between one to the other.\\n\\nIt's around the wrong way.\\n\\nI'm going to do.\\n\\nSo I'm going to have many sections for many Ds.\\n\\nSo I'm going to go the other way there.\\n\\nSo it better, you can see there when I highlight it, you know, it shows one and the star, star being many, so one to many.\\n\\nSo I've got one course ID, it's going to have many sections.\\n\\nSo the course ID here, this is not going to be a primary key, there's going to be multiple versions that will be same course ID for all the different sort of pages that we're going to have on our course.\\n\\nOkay so let's have a look at that.\\n\\nSo we've got courses, we've got the courses linking from to the section.\\n\\nWe now need the.\\n\\nagain same sort of thing.\\n\\nSo you can drag and drop that and we'll do those lines for you.\\n\\nYou could write this up, anyway there's nothing stopping you from doing that kind of beauty of this tool is that you know you've got a GUI for when you want to use it and you've also got a quite nice markup language that's easy to share.\\n\\nAnother good thing about this having it be all sort of a markup language that's not specific you can actually this is this is independent of database it is.\\n\\nSo in the case of our project we are using Superbase which is basically a hosted Postgres database.\\n\\nSo we can make it export this to some Postgres SQL or flavor of Postgres SQL but this dbml language is actually to the database agnostic so we could maybe even export the same thing for the links of MySQL or Microsoft SQL as well I believe.\\n\\nOkay so we've got the courses, I've got the courses section, courses media and we're gonna have the comment ID.\\n\\nWhat did I miss?\\n\\nI know what I missed.\\n\\nI didn't have anything in my courses comments.\\n\\nWell we have an ID, we don't have any way to link that back to the media itself.\\n\\nOkay so let's add that.\\n\\nIdea ID.\\n\\nCool, okay and then we are going to then link that MediaID from here to there.\\n\\nLike that, cool and so if we auto-arrange it, I'll tidy that out nicely for us.\\n\\nOkay, so now we're starting to get that sort of structure there, so we can have you know one section can have many media items in it and of course a media item can have many comments against it.\\n\\nSo the students would be able to you know maybe ask questions or they could maybe tag their instructor or just try and get some clarification or maybe put something in a way that they understand it better.\\n\\nSo that way of course then the course in question is going to actually be make a lot more sense to a lot more people.\\n\\nOkay so we have the courses, course section, course media and the courses comments.\\n\\nYou go a little bit of a little bit of play here, you can choose which colour your actual the theming I guess for the diagram is so we can do the same where we can Have a whole lot of the structure of tables here and that To me I guess the one of the key Tables that we're going to require There's one that's going to have the students information Okay, so students information again Something like that.\\n\\nWe are going to need a student ID.\\n\\nLike so.\\n\\nAgain, primary key.\\n\\nAnd we are going to have created it.\\n\\nI missed that on some of our other tables.\\n\\nProbably thinking why do you need to create it on all these tables?\\n\\nThe good thing about a database is by having this extra metadata around it, not only do we have the information about what record was being added, knowing when is actually going to be helpful as well.\\n\\nSo maybe we have an error log in our application and we could actually then draw back through the created at records there.\\n\\nSo we might be able to see if there was an issue there with that table that could give us some insight there.\\n\\nTo that, we've got auditing.\\n\\nSo a big thing about a lot of apps and the like is it's very helpful to know when something happened or something was recorded.\\n\\nSo having that created at timestamp with the buffer date and the time there plus the, normally it's stored in a format which is like UGC or something of a likes so that it's universal time and all the calculations can be converted to a local time zone if needed.\\n\\nSo we've got students, student ID created at, we will also need I guess a big first thing that someone needs, a person or a human or a student, in this case is going to be their first name.\\n\\nAnd I'm going to give that a voucher.\\n\\nI can give my last name.\\n\\nAgain voucher and I'm also going to give them a email because I need some sort of form of connecting their accounts and getting notifications etc.\\n\\nOkay so we've got the ID created at the first name, last name, email etc.\\n\\nOkay so we've now got our students table.\\n\\nGoing back to our comments, we actually had the student ID here so we would expect there to be a link there between the student ID and the comment.\\n\\nOk so they need to, we know then that this table now is linked via IDs here and why have we done it this way?\\n\\nWell the big thing that remember is with databases and the like, we try to make our data so that it can easily be updated or changed.\\n\\nIt's common these days for people if they get married or in a civil union etc they may change their last name so it would be annoying if you had to repeat the first name and last name on all the comments so that when that user updates their details, then we'd have to go into multiple records there and I'll take those records if we were storing their first name and last name.\\n\\nBut instead of course we're storing the student ID.\\n\\nSo we're storing instead the link between this table and the other and that's it.\\n\\nWhich means that if we do change, If they need to change their last name or first name or email address, they can do so and they are only going to have to update it in one record and not across the entire database.\\n\\nAlright, okay, so we've got the courses.\\n\\nI'm going to actually get this different colour just to make it a little bit easier for us to easily visually see that.\\n\\nOh, looks like I don't get that feature.\\n\\na shame.\\n\\nSo that's one of the pro features there.\\n\\nNot to worry, we can still see that.\\n\\nOkay so we've got the courses, courses section, courses of media, courses comments, we've got students and we're going to need some way of tracking, I guess the progress of where our students granularity, we would I want to actually record where the student got up to.\\n\\nI could have it right down to the media itself, but I think that that's probably too low into the details.\\n\\nI'd probably be okay if we just did just track the progress of the student as maybe they got to page two or page three of the course.\\n\\nSo the section is where I probably want my granularity at.\\n\\nSo each student is going to need a progression.\\n\\nSo what we can do for that is we can create a Students progress table, I think I think that's what we'll call it Table students progress Okay, so this is going to record like I said The student the course that they're on and what section that they are up to okay, so Good thing for this is we probably can get away with the one record per student per course and that way we should be fine in that regards to just track that.\\n\\nSo we can do, so we've got the student ID, We're going to have the course section ID, so we're going to need what section ID that they're up to.\\n\\nAnd then after that, we're going to need to have a Hi there in the chat, I just noticed, sorry.\\n\\nAnd we're going to need to have, of course, the, we know what's last may be modified.\\n\\nI think that would be a good one to have and of course the course ID.\\n\\nI missed that out, that's pretty important.\\n\\nSo again, this whole record is going to be made up of these three things.\\n\\nIt's going to be the ID, the course ID, those are the two main records there that we're sort of interested in and section ID I guess will actually be their progress.\\n\\nCreated it, that would be handy to have some auditing there, somewhere they first started.\\n\\nAnd again thinking about sort of auditing again, modified at again, this is going to be so when say like the section ID would change.\\n\\nSo I'd sort of see it that this table would be tracking the progress of a student.\\n\\nAgain it's linked up between the course ID And it's going to be linked to the student.\\n\\nOkay, and so we're going to have this sort of relationship here between.\\n\\nMove that out of the way, make it a little bit easier, see?\\n\\nBetween the student there and their progress.\\n\\nOkay, so I'd see that their section ID would change as they traverse through the course.\\n\\nthey go to the next page, we could then record the following section ID and then we could also update the modified at time stamps so that we keep in that progression there.\\n\\nSo that when a student comes back in, maybe the first time that they come into the landing page, we have their listed courses and a sort of resume button to resume from where they were last on the course.\\n\\nCool, okay so it's starting to really all come together now.\\n\\nBe careful, don't you want to go back and lose any of our progress?\\n\\nBut you know it looks like it's nicely arranged that for us again.\\n\\nOkay so just double checking on that.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nI'm going to give it a name.\\n\\nIt's always good to name stuff.\\n\\nthis is our LMS entity relationship diagram.\\n\\nI hope so I can spell.\\n\\nthere we go, relationship diagram.\\n\\nSo it's looking a bit better.\\n\\nCool, okay.\\n\\nOkay, we're pretty happy with that.\\n\\nThis looking, you know, we can now visually see on our head how this all this data structure is now all laid out.\\n\\nWe've got a nice little diagram for it.\\n\\nIt's good to document these kind of things.\\n\\nSometimes, you know, you don't have to use of course this tool.\\n\\nMaybe it's easier for you just to sketch this out on a piece of paper.\\n\\nBut this is something that will, you know, sort of helps cement in your head, how you're going to have that actually structure of the data there.\\n\\nOkay so let's actually go to, well the thing I love most about this tool is it's got an ability there to export some PostgreSQL here.\\n\\nSo you can export it, you can export this as a PDF, PNG, CNG.\\n\\nSo you can put that into say your documentation.\\n\\nMaybe you put it into a wiki, will you read me or something like that?\\n\\nYou can do that but you can also use the dvml to generate the Postgres SQL that you're going to need to be able to create your tables.\\n\\nOkay, I just noticed a typo I've got there That might help, it's not an it, it's an int.\\n\\nOkay so it's an integer.\\n\\nOkay so let's do that and what we can do now, so let's just have a look here at the 'Ft-Q's'.\\n\\nI think there was any more details about that.\\n\\nNo it doesn't like it.\\n\\nSo you can go into here, you can export your Postgres SQL.\\n\\nOkay so that's gone and downloaded that for me.\\n\\nI'm going to open that in another screen.\\n\\nOkay so coming back to Superbasis itself, we've got the likes of a table already created for our courses.\\n\\nOkay so what we can do now, it has a great little tool here, so you've got the actual, you've got the table editor itself but you've also got the SQL editor.\\n\\nSo if we open up that, now we've got a basically a free area where in a web app we can go and add our table.\\n\\nFirst thing we're going to do because I've made probably a few little changes, I think to my courses.\\n\\nI'm just going to actually just drop that table.\\n\\nThat's okay.\\n\\nDropping off the cascade there, so I can delete all that.\\n\\nI shouldn't have been in any cascade anyway because there's nothing linked between them but why not.\\n\\nOkay so like I said we exported the SQL there from our DBML So let's have take a look at it here.\\n\\nSo we've got the courses table if you can see it slightly changed the DBML to the Postgres SQL flavor of SQL So looking that Between the two so you got courses ID there primary key.\\n\\nIt's a slightly different But it actually you know, it's still very easy to read SQL as one of those languages But isn't too far from English there It's not a big stretch To be able to easily follow Okay, so we've got the courses.\\n\\nWe've got the courses section got the section ID the course ID the integer title Vacher order again media That's okay.\\n\\nOf course it's comments.\\n\\nStudents and the students progress.\\n\\nIf we follow down here, you can see where it's got the alter table and it's altering the table name.\\n\\nAdding a foreign key and so it's reference to that certain ID.\\n\\nLet's actually just go ahead and run that.\\n\\nThat's all looking okay to me.\\n\\nOkay, cool.\\n\\nSo now, we should have all our courses created.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nOkay, looks like there's warning there and we're going to enable some road level security.\\n\\nBut you can see it's created that course as we had it in the SQL here.\\n\\nSo we've got the id, we've created that, the course name, theta description, image again and we'll have the same again for all the different tables here.\\n\\nSo this is a great way of being able to quickly sort of sketch out in a tool like this dvdiagram.\\n\\nio get the I guess the entities of the database how you would like to have them and yeah just be able to export them to some SQL that you can then run in a Postgres database or in our case run it on Superbase which is basically a hosted version of Postgres for us.\\n\\nOnce that's done we should then have all the tables should have the foreign keys and the linking between them so that if say I had a course and I created a record here, it would expect in the courses section that that's going to be linked to that course ID.\\n\\nOkay, it has to be linked to our record there because we had it as part of our SQL here.\\n\\nAnother great thing about this, now we've got some SQL that is available for us.\\n\\nI mean we can keep a copy of that.\\n\\nlikely we can check that into our source control.\\n\\nSo it could be used as sort of a manual migration which would mean that whenever we wanted to set up an environment like this, with the like surf base we can literally start a new account, start a new project and again be be able to replicate that whole structure again of our database structure.\\n\\nAnd what I could also do, probably next step would be to go and create some SQL to add some content there.\\n\\nThe beauty of that, having it done by an SQL statement again is, you know, we can come back if we destroy the database, we break something on it, we can roll it back to a previous state, which is something we always want to be able to do with both our source code and our data.\\n\\nSo that's again allow us to do that.\\n\\nBut again like the DB diagram tool is you know such a great easy to use tool for something that's again I'm quite a visual person and I find it very much easier to sort of start getting that sort of laid out and a sort of visual representation that helps me think about the way that the data is going to be structured and how I can actually build out my database.\\n\\nIs this the VL and end all?\\n\\nIs it finished?\\n\\nNo, it's not.\\n\\nI will probably change my ideas at later stages but it's you know at this point we're just trying to get sort of the MVP the most most valuable product I was like the one I like to call it again make that most valuable product and this is a great way to get started putting at your table structure having an individual way you know you've got a record of it both as some SQL and you could also export it as a PDF or SVG etc.\\n\\nSo you can embed it in your documentation and you've got that sort of structure there that's saved.\\n\\nI'll be able to come back to this.\\n\\nIt makes these nice links here that so you can actually even share these in this tool.\\n\\nSo you can see here I've got the share and I can share composite protector, can get invite people etc.\\n\\nwhich is pretty cool.\\n\\nAnd another thing that it also allows is we do have the history here so we can roll back in time to see and change that.\\n\\nWe've actually got November 2022.\\n\\nThat's the last time I used that previously, but that's cool.\\n\\nInteresting to know.\\n\\nAnd of course for you lovers of Dark Mode, there is a Dark Mode.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nAgain, I'm going to link this into the chat here.\\n\\nFeel free to have a play, make your own database diagram.\\n\\nI'm going to link this into the documentation so you'll be able to come back to this and I add it to the project.\\n\\nI'm going to grab that SQL as well and add that to the project so that we can roll it back and what I'll do is I'll give it the date and time of when that was created and add that to the SQL file so that we can come back to it at a later point.\\n\\nBut that's yeah that's how to design a database in a web tool called dbdiagram.io.\\n\\nHopefully you enjoyed that and you learned something, please like and subscribe.\\n\\nI've been blown away by the number of people that have been subscribing to the channel.\\n\\nIt definitely makes me want to keep doing this.\\n\\nI'm going to try and keep at it.\\n\\nWe've still got a long way to go for our LMS project and I might look at updating the frequency of these because of course the faster the more I do in a week, the faster we get along in progress, and we've still got ages to go.\\n\\nAll right, thanks for your time, I hope you enjoyed it and I will see you next time.\\n\\nBye.\\n\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"jnJ2q0H0+RgGMqKC2g5AgQ0bDI5Re5jRZz3BMHtwSC8=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md_1":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md_1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md\",\"file_name\":\"build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"---\\ntitle:

This is part 5 of the series. In it we start further planning and using a kanban board to track our progress. To do this we use GitHub projects and generate a board and create some issues/tickets to build. We also start building out the components for the project.\\n\\nThe project is available on GitHub as LMS NextJS.\\n\\nThe GitHub project board is available on GitHub as @andrewjamesford's LMS Project.\\n\\nyoutube.com/embed/UUDUUrG-LDw?si=NC3-gYFDnArwXzC7\\n\\n---\\n\\nAll right.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo, Andrew here again.\\n\\nI'm going to go over a little bit of what we did last night and continue on with the actual planning of what we're actually going to build.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo, if you watched the stream last night, you would have seen I had an entity relationship diagram.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo, just going to pause the monitoring for a sec.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nAll right.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo, what do we got here?\\n\\nWe have our table structure.\\n\\nSo, we've got all the database here, our courses, our courses section, courses media, courses comments, students and students progress.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nWe went into the SQL editor for Superbase and we ran the query that was generated from the ERD diagram tool, DB diagram.\\n\\nio.\\n\\nWe ran that and now we have some tables.\\n\\nLet's pull that up.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo, you guys can see that.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo, you got courses, courses comments, courses media, courses section, students, students progress.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nIf we go into each of these, I'm probably going to have to do a little bit of editing.\\n\\nSo, we've got the courses.\\n\\nWe've got the values here.\\n\\nMake sure we make it an identity on these.\\n\\nSo, we're going to go through, update these tables, make sure they've got the, I guess, the Superbase specific things.\\n\\nLet's make that correct.\\n\\nI'll show you that.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nThe one downside, I guess, of writing the SQL separate.\\n\\nAnd again, it's identity.\\n\\nI think I felt these are all not available.\\n\\nWe can change this later, of course.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nAll right.\\n\\nSo, that's there.\\n\\nSo, as you can probably see, we're starting to get into, I guess, the, not quite the coding stage yet, but we're pretty much at this point now.\\n\\nWe are ready to show things off.\\n\\nSo, we can do that by waiting for that to save.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nLet's make sure my work's in the right position now.\\n\\nThat's better.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo, we've got the courses section.\\n\\nI'm going to edit that.\\n\\nCome in here.\\n\\nHow's identity?\\n\\nWe'll go through this.\\n\\nFor those that watched the video last night or want to catch up, there actually is an SQL that's been added to the project.\\n\\nSo, you'll be able to go into the description and you should be able to see the link to the GitHub repo.\\n\\nIn this SQL folder, there should be the latest update from dbdiagram.io, which has the actual SQL that we used to create these tables.\\n\\nYou can do the same or not.\\n\\nYou can jump in and you can also manually make these.\\n\\nThere's no right or wrong way.\\n\\nIt's just a good way of being able to visualize it before you get going.\\n\\nAnd last, let's add that ID.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo, this one.\\n\\nThis one, we don't need to actually have the ID yet because this is just a linking table.\\n\\nI'm not going to leave that as is, which is cool.\\n\\nAll right.\\n\\nLet's pull up GitHub.\\n\\nSo, with the project, we've done a lot of, I guess, putting stuff together just so that we can actually start getting started.\\n\\nI know it's quite scary, isn't it, when the fact that we are on the fifth video in the series and we're really only just getting to the point where we can start sort of actually thinking about doing the code itself.\\n\\nAnd that's the same with any project.\\n\\nAnything that has a lot of complications to it or anything like that, it's actually really important that you do a little bit of planning.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo, we've got that there.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo, in GitHub, you actually have some project management tools and they're tucked away in the project section here.\\n\\nAnd by default, there is nothing, no project created yet.\\n\\nBut we can create a new project for this.\\n\\nClick on the button.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nAnd I'm going to call this LMS.\\n\\nProject.\\n\\nI'm going to use the table, probably board view.\\n\\nThat's what I prefer, a Kanban board.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo, we create that.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nAnd we've got a basic sort of Kanban board structure there that we can now use for our project.\\n\\nI'm going to do, I've got another one to do.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nAnd we've got the LMS there.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo, now it's got this project actually attached against it, which is great.\\n\\nSo, we'd be able to easily see that that's attached.\\n\\nAnd we've got three columns here.\\n\\nWe're going to do a hidden progress and a done.\\n\\nNow, I don't know about you, but I like to actually start sort of thinking about what I'm going to build first, how I'm going to build it, what are the things that I need to do.\\n\\nAnd then I just end up with a big to do list.\\n\\nI'm going to make one more column here.\\n\\nSo, we've got a to do and progress.\\n\\nThat'll make it backlog.\\n\\nYeah, I'll make it backlog.\\n\\nWhy am I making a backlog?\\n\\nThis is like things that I may want to build, but I haven't actually decided yet if I'm really going to go through with it.\\n\\nSo, I'm going to make a backlog and I'm going to move that to be in the front here.\\n\\nIdeas are things to build.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo, backlog, whatever I want to think about, I could add to the project.\\n\\nI can add that to the backlog.\\n\\nBut when I am actually pretty sure that that's actually what I would do, want to build, I'll add it to the to do list.\\n\\nSort of like a way to have a big long list of things that maybe we'll get around to do.\\n\\nSo, that's all good.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo, we've got a backlog there.\\n\\nSo, I don't need to write anything about that.\\n\\nWe have created the tables that we require.\\n\\nAnd let's step back to, I guess, thinking about the project as sort of an MVP.\\n\\nSo, what do we have?\\n\\nWe have at the moment, we don't have a lot actually.\\n\\nLet's run that so that everyone can see that.\\n\\nI'm going to run up the dev on the container and I'll load it in the browser.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nNot a lot there at the moment.\\n\\nA homepage and very basic structure.\\n\\nWe've got, I guess, the basics of our project here using XJS.\\n\\nAnd it's loading in some CSS at the moment.\\n\\nWe've got a few HTML tags.\\n\\nOf course, the route where the actual React app is being implemented.\\n\\nAnd that's looking cool.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo, for the next part, in the project itself, we had a router.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nAnd in that router, we had a courses page.\\n\\nLet's see if that's still working actually.\\n\\nThis courses.\\n\\nWhat's the route?\\n\\nLet's see if that works.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo, I've got my data.\\n\\nIt doesn't look like it'll be breaking, which is probably a good thing.\\n\\nBut it's not loading anything because we've got no data there.\\n\\nThat's fine.\\n\\nWe'll get to that in a sec.\\n\\nThinking about the actual project in its entirety.\\n\\nWhat are the key things, I guess, that anything, any sort of project needs?\\n\\nIn a lot of time, it'll be something, you know, the basics.\\n\\nSo we've created a database that we can use in our project.\\n\\nWe've got the foundations, I guess, for the actual React app itself.\\n\\nSo that's using Next.js.\\n\\nWe're going to be using the Radix UI elements in this project.\\n\\nSo we've got a, I guess, a bit of a shortcut there and how we can actually see those.\\n\\nWe're also going to have a, I guess, a way to actually manage the users.\\n\\nSo we're going to have students sign up, of course, and they're going to have to have some way to do that.\\n\\nSo coming in, back to the Kanban board, we can look at it.\\n\\nAnd a pretty common thing that you probably need is a sign up page.\\n\\nOkay, we need a login page.\\n\\nOkay, what else are we going to need?\\n\\nWe're going to sign up, we're going to log in, essentially a forgot password.\\n\\nThinking about all the sort of permutations of what's actually going to be required there.\\n\\nSign up page, login page, forgot password, what else are we going to need?\\n\\nAnything else we can think of?\\n\\nTop of my head.\\n\\nI think that should be fine.\\n\\nWe could make a new password.\\n\\nI should actually be calling these routes rather than pages.\\n\\nSo that we can route the user where they are needed rather than.\\n\\nOkay, so we can edit the title.\\n\\nYeah, forgot password route.\\n\\nSo these are not the components themselves.\\n\\nThis is what I'm thinking of in terms of the routing, in terms of the XJS.\\n\\nBecause we need a way to get to the components that we're going to be seeing.\\n\\nAnd we need to be able to actually navigate that, of course, from a URL.\\n\\nAnd why do we do this?\\n\\nWell, there's a couple of good things.\\n\\nWhy we actually set up all these routes and the like.\\n\\nSo a good thing about any sort of website, it's a really good idea to think about all the routes in terms of your HTML is something that you can actually pass off to another application.\\n\\nThe great thing about links is you can embed them in, say, a message, or you can embed them in an email.\\n\\nWhen a user clicks on those, the user would be redirected to that part on the website.\\n\\nAnd it's better than, I guess, having stage controlling all the different routes.\\n\\nInstead, we can use the URL, which is something that stays the same in this, in the actual sort of URL bar in a browser, and take advantage of that to hold our state of where the actual user has navigated to.\\n\\nAnd that's probably a key thing about websites is that they have this inbuilt state there, this really clever process of the URL.\\n\\nVery simplistic, but really powerful when you think about what you can do with a URL in terms of being able to direct someone to do something.\\n\\nWe can look at the URL that we've got here for the GitHub project.\\n\\nAnd we can see it's got, of course, the domain to get to the site.\\n\\nThe users, so it's got the Andrew James 4 there, that's my GitHub username.\\n\\nIt's got projects, it's got a number 4, so that's obviously the project number 4 that's been created.\\n\\nAnd you've even got like a view there, it's got like an identifier of one, and it's actually even got some parameters there.\\n\\nSo before we change some of these, we may actually, let's see what happens to our state.\\n\\nWe should get some changes.\\n\\nYeah, so now we don't see the actual issue itself.\\n\\nOnce we click on it, we can see the issue, we can see the item ID.\\n\\nIf I click on to some of these others, of course the ID changes.\\n\\nSo very powerful, I think, a URL.\\n\\nIt's probably something we don't think about a lot, but it's really important to think about it in terms of you'd be able to send someone an email to say, hey, you forgot your password.\\n\\nSo when you go for that whole process of a forgot password route, then we can actually get them to go to the direct form that they need to go to, maybe to reset that password.\\n\\nAnd it's all at all at really important parts of building web applications.\\n\\nOkay, so we've got a signup page, I've got a logon page route, I've got a forgot password route, I've got a new password route.\\n\\nSo these are the actual routes themselves.\\n\\nSo there's a little bit of boilerplates we need to do for that in terms of with the Next.js documentation.\\n\\nSo previously we had, of course, the page folder, so you have the folder name.\\n\\nSo you can have like a signup route folder name.\\n\\nAnd in that route, you could have the page.\\n\\njs file, which would actually be, I guess, the routing page to it.\\n\\nAnd then you could, of course, load components after that with the likes of React.\\n\\nOkay, so I've got these routes here, I've got the project.\\n\\nSo we should be able to, let's quickly switch to that.\\n\\nOkay, you should be able to see the project itself.\\n\\nOkay, so this is my last sort of changes I did from last night around the ERD diagram.\\n\\nSo I've got a link there to dbdiagram.io and the markdown file.\\n\\nAnd I've got a link to the extensions and a little bit of help here, where this is all located, a link to the playlist, etc.\\n\\nSo that's still being updated.\\n\\nThe project's running at the moment, you can see I've got it running under a dev container for my project.\\n\\nSo I've got a docker running and the actual project is running like so.\\n\\nNow let's go to the courses folder.\\n\\nSo with this, I've got a page.\\n\\njs.\\n\\nAnd in here, I've got a basically the courses heading, some way of getting the data and putting that onto the page.\\n\\nSo like again, talking about the routes there.\\n\\nSo in the case of a sign up or sign out, we were going to have to do all those kind of steps.\\n\\nAnd we're likely enough to have a login page, I believe already.\\n\\nOkay, so we've got this pre-configured.\\n\\nI believe this is from the template.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nAnd we've also got, you can see there, you've got some form actions.\\n\\nSo we've got the, I guess the behind the scenes, the sign up, the sign out.\\n\\nSo you've got all this logic here in terms of the API and the actual project already as part of the boilerplate.\\n\\nOkay, and we've got a sign in.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nOkay, so we've got a login already.\\n\\nLet's check that.\\n\\nLet's actually have a look at that in the actual browser itself.\\n\\nIt's always paged actually, get a sort of lay of land.\\n\\nWhat actually is happening?\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nNice.\\n\\nOkay, so they've got, they've actually got the same page for the login, sign in and sign up, which is actually not a bad place.\\n\\nI'm probably going to want some extra details going by what we had for the students table.\\n\\nSo we will need the email.\\n\\nWe will need their password, but we will also need the likes of their first name and last name, just to personalize parts of the actual application itself.\\n\\nSo we can do that.\\n\\nAnd so if I tried to sign in now, it's got some basic validation there on the actual code.\\n\\nSorry, you probably can't see that.\\n\\nSo I'll switch to that.\\n\\nMy problem is here.\\n\\nGlad you're enjoying it.\\n\\nOf course, you can always catch up on the streams anyway.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo we've got the signup page.\\n\\nYou guys can see that.\\n\\nOkay, that's a bit better.\\n\\nMuch easier to see now.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nTypical.\\n\\nMy chat started to not work.\\n\\nThat's okay.\\n\\nI might just open that another window.\\n\\nIt might be easier.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nReally important.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nOkay, so we've got the login form.\\n\\nSo we should be able to see that, like I said before, sign in, sign up.\\n\\nBasics of what we need.\\n\\nLet's check what the back button does.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nThat's just going to go back to the history, which is not bad at all.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo a lot of that is kind of done for us.\\n\\nI'm going to probably change that.\\n\\nThat's okay.\\n\\nWe can change this later.\\n\\nI'm still going to keep these login page out and I'm going to also keep the signup page out.\\n\\nI'm a big fan of actually having separate routes for each of those.\\n\\nAnd that's okay.\\n\\nWe'll leave it as like that for now.\\n\\nSo we will need that sort of signup route.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nAnd let's go to the.\\n\\nI guess what are the next things we need?\\n\\nWell, going by our project, you can see it's very, very basic.\\n\\nWe don't have to go, we've got any sort of elements as such here.\\n\\nWe've literally got a main here.\\n\\nWe've got a title and that's about it.\\n\\nSo there's nothing really that we can sort of see in our sort of design here.\\n\\nNow did we, let's go back to the project itself.\\n\\nIn the case of earlier on, we did do some designing.\\n\\nSo where is that?\\n\\nLet's find it.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nOpen up this project.\\n\\nNot easy to find.\\n\\nI'm going to go and actually I'll just have a quick look through my channel.\\n\\nI believe I actually added it onto one of the videos of course.\\n\\nI've created transcripts for all my videos.\\n\\nSo let's go back and actually have a look at it.\\n\\nSo we had the LMS with this basic design here.\\n\\nI don't believe that we do any.\\n\\nThere we go.\\n\\nWireframes are here.\\n\\nPerfect.\\n\\nAwesome.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo going back to our design, it's very very simplistic.\\n\\nWe've got our sign up form and we've already started to actually change, I guess, some of these pages.\\n\\nSign up here with course overview.\\n\\nIt's looking cool.\\n\\nThis is a great thing of why you document things.\\n\\nI could just quickly go back to my transcript there and grab that link.\\n\\nThat's there.\\n\\nAble for you guys to be able to jump through and have a look at it as well.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nSo got the course detail.\\n\\nSo overview.\\n\\nWe've got the sign up and login.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nWe have done it very much the same.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nIt's a good thing to go back to our designs here.\\n\\nThis is the problem, I guess, of going over something that I haven't come back to in a couple of weeks, which is all good.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo we've got the LinkedIn there, Microsoft, Google, etc.\\n\\nBlah blah blah.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo we've got that there.\\n\\nThinking about it in terms of like basic structure.\\n\\nWe're going to need a header and that header we're going to need a logo and that header we're going to need a menu.\\n\\nSo a nav bar of some sort.\\n\\nAnd we're also going to need a footer.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo let's actually start making those into some more tickets.\\n\\nAgain, so I'm going to make a header component like so.\\n\\nAnd in that I'm going to have a logo title.\\n\\nGot some quickly be back in a sec.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nNow, since you're getting into a very very specific category, you're going to want to start with the same category.\\n\\nYou're going to want to start with a different category.\\n\\nNow, you're going to want to start with the same category.\\n\\nSo, you're going to want to start with the same category.\\n\\nOkay, it's going to have a Nav component.\\n\\nWe're also going to need something that's probably pretty common to what most people want in any project is a footer and like so.\\n\\nWhat else we need?\\n\\nFoot and Nav.\\n\\nMight just rename this one.\\n\\nI'm calling it a header.\\n\\nAwesome.\\n\\nOkay, so we've got a header, footer, foot navigation.\\n\\nOkay, so a lot of it I guess is the planning stages and a good place probably to start is this login page route.\\n\\nWhat I can do, we're going to need a header anyway.\\n\\nGoing back to Excalidraw and our designs here.\\n\\nSo, we've got the header following the user all the way through from the links of the homepage, the signup page, login page, course overview, course detail.\\n\\nSo, again, this is a component that we're going to use throughout the actual application.\\n\\nSo, it's a good place probably to start with that login page because then we can actually then start showing the user to be signed in.\\n\\nThere'll probably be some sort of way to show the user that they are logged in or not.\\n\\nMaybe to get to settings that they want to have for their specific user.\\n\\nDo they want a light mode or dark mode or something like that?\\n\\nWe can do something like that.\\n\\nThat's all stuff to think about in the future and so we don't forget about it.\\n\\nI'm just going to add a, just like you've got here, you can see in the avatar, we've got the avatar.\\n\\nWe can do an avatar component and that's just to show that when someone's logged in they know who they're logged in as and it's obvious to the user.\\n\\nOkay, so sitting in my backlog, it's not sitting in the do, that means it's not, it doesn't mean that I'm not going to do it, it just means that I'm not going to do it right now.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo, we can start off with two things.\\n\\nWe could start off with creating the route, which is fine for the login, that, but I think it'll probably even go, even back a step and just go maybe focus on that header component.\\n\\nOkay, I think that's probably a really good place to start, you know, at the top of the page and with that header component, it's going to require to have that logo title component and the header nav component.\\n\\nWe'll leave the avatar for the time being, but that way at least we have something to do it.\\n\\nNow I've done something that I probably shouldn't have done.\\n\\nThe idea of a backlog as well is to be able to fill in all the description that you're going to add to the tickets.\\n\\nSo, I might just move these back for the time being and we'll start off with just the header component there.\\n\\nOkay, so what is it?\\n\\nWe want to give it a decent description here.\\n\\nOkay, let's see if we can get a little edit.\\n\\nOkay, we've got some markdown.\\n\\nOkay, a React header component contains header components like logo and navigation.\\n\\nWe'll show on every page.\\n\\nOkay, so this needs to be able to be seen everywhere.\\n\\nWe also need it to, going back looking at our Scala drawer here, we need it to be responsive.\\n\\nSo, the other things it's going to require is that responsive design, mobile, tablet and desktop.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nWhat else do we need?\\n\\nWe've got the responsive design, we'll show on every page and web app, responsive design, mobile, tablet, desktop, a React header component contains header components like logo and navigation can be themed.\\n\\nSo, we don't forget about that.\\n\\nSo we add some color to it or something like that, but we need to be able to make it so we can do that.\\n\\nWe'll look at that, I guess, with the Radix UI libraries for it.\\n\\nAnd what else could we add here?\\n\\nThat's going to help us build this.\\n\\nThat's all we've got so far.\\n\\nThat's okay.\\n\\nWe can update that comment.\\n\\nLet's just make this into a list.\\n\\nAgain, we've got the power of mark down here.\\n\\nSo, we can do that.\\n\\nIt can be themed.\\n\\nOkay, so we've got the Radix UI there.\\n\\nWe'll add that to the logo, but I was going to add, say, the logo needs to be able to have a link, I guess, to the actual main URL of the page.\\n\\nBut we'll add that to the actual logo itself.\\n\\nLikewise, for the navigation, there'll be a home link.\\n\\nWe'll show you our new page on the web app.\\n\\nWhat else do we need to think about?\\n\\nI think that's pretty much it.\\n\\nI'm going to update that comment.\\n\\nOkay, so it's in the tutorial here.\\n\\nLike so.\\n\\nBy default, these items are just drafts.\\n\\nSo we can actually do the conversion there to an issue.\\n\\nThe great thing about that is it's now going to allow us to attach it to a project.\\n\\nOkay, so we've got project name, LMS next.\\n\\njs, and we've got a number one there.\\n\\nSo this is our first ticket.\\n\\nOftentimes, there might be a component.\\n\\nIt could be a configuration set up.\\n\\nIt could be something else like that.\\n\\nIt could be a range of things.\\n\\nBut at this point, I'm just going to leave it at that for a header component.\\n\\nOkay, let's go and take a look at, instead, the structure of the project.\\n\\nSo I'll switch to that.\\n\\nOkay, so now let's have a look.\\n\\nOkay, so we've got a few pages.\\n\\nI'm going to close all these just to keep it clear.\\n\\nNow, I've got a components folder.\\n\\nI've got a logout button.\\n\\nBut that's about it for the time being.\\n\\nSo we can actually add, I guess, our header components to here.\\n\\nIt's going to make a new file.\\n\\nAnd I'm just going to call it header.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nNext.\\n\\njs, React and React.\\n\\nI hit HTML tag.\\n\\nSo I'll view the chat.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo we've got our own folder.\\n\\nAnd I'm going to do that.\\n\\nIt's just like my little junior developer.\\n\\nOkay, so I've got a nice little function here.\\n\\nI can copy that.\\n\\nIt's probably a little bit hard to see with my face in the way.\\n\\nLet's make it a little bit bigger.\\n\\nBut basically, what it's doing, I just quickly chatted to to copilot there.\\n\\nIt's going to make sort of the basics there of what I need for the project.\\n\\nAnd like so, I'm not sure I actually need to do that.\\n\\nI don't like this function layout.\\n\\nI can probably do it more like this one here.\\n\\nWe've got the export default.\\n\\nIt's probably a little bit tidier.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nAnd we can get rid of that now.\\n\\nAwesome.\\n\\nIt didn't quite do what I wanted.\\n\\nIt's got just a div for that.\\n\\nI want an actual semantic HTML tag for that.\\n\\nSo I'm going to use the actual header tag and replace that div.\\n\\nAnd we've got the start of our here.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nLooks like I'm about to run out of time.\\n\\nLet's sort of take stock of where we're at.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo what have we done today?\\n\\nWe started planning.\\n\\nSo we've actually started to plan what we're actually going to build.\\n\\nSo going back to the project, we've now got a Kanban board underway.\\n\\nWe are now in progress.\\n\\nSo let's move that ticket to there.\\n\\nAnd we've got that header component is underway.\\n\\nI've started to create that Js file.\\n\\nAnd it's got just basically the header in it.\\n\\nAnd we need to basically continue from there.\\n\\nBut we will come back in another time.\\n\\nSo please like and subscribe to my channel.\\n\\nIt gives me an indication of the people liking this and people want to keep following along.\\n\\nPlease share with any friends that are wanting to code as well.\\n\\nIt's hopefully beneficial to everyone to watch these videos.\\n\\nAnd it's going to be helpful in getting that sort of mindset of how to build an app.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo thank you again for your time.\\n\\nAnd I will see you next time.\\n\\nBye.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\n_Please note this transcript was edited for

Next.js project, starting with brainstorming ideas on a virtual whiteboard. Wireframes were then created in Excalidraw to visualize pages like home, sign up, course listings, and course details. Key requirements around authentication, data storage, roles and permissions were mapped out. Superbase was selected to provide authentication via LinkedIn/Google login as well as for it being a Postgres database. Next.js was chosen for its React framework and Radix UI was selected for accessible, customizable UI components to speed up development.\\nogimage: \\\"full-stack1.jpg\\\"\\n---\\n\\n{% figure \\\"./full-stack1.jpg\\\", \\\"&quot;A web full-stack app built with NextJS&quot; / Bing Image Creator\\\" %}\\n\\nThe following is a transcript of my live stream on YouTube Sep 14, 2023 on Dev Containers in VS Code. This transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity. In this stream I went over the planning stages of a project. First on a virtual whiteboard. I started with a brainstorm of ideas, then moved onto wireframes. Then circled back to start thinking about what features and functionality I would need to build the app. I also talked about the pros and cons of building a UI library from scratch or using something that is already pre-tested and available. Finally I went over the data structure and how I would store the data.\\n\\nTo view the Wireframes I created in the stream, please see the following link:\\nWireframes on Excalidraw\\n\\nyoutube.com/embed/4xhebsXoSn4?si=YdTF06KTLVE8xH24\\n\\n{% figure \\\"./whiteboard.png\\\", \\\"The Whiteboard from the Stream\\\" %}\\n\\n---\\n\\nAll right.\\n\\nAlright, we are live, sorry for the delay.\\n\\nCan you even hear me?\\n\\nThere's a few people watching on the stream.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nAlright, so what am I doing today?\\n\\nI am going to build a full stack app with Next.js.\\n\\nSo I had a few ideas for projects, but something I guess that is kind of floating my boat is trying to build an LMS.\\n\\nAnd an LMS, a learning management system, can have things like videos, code tutorials, documents.\\n\\nThere's a whole range of things.\\n\\nAnd what the cool thing about it is there are parts of the app that will need to be public, and there will be parts that will need to be private.\\n\\nYou will also need some sort of login, and there will be some need for an admin of some sort as well.\\n\\nSo it's quite a big wide ranging project, and I know I'm not going to be able to do it all in one hour.\\n\\nSo it's going to be a constant stream of every couple of days I will try and chip away a little bit more in it.\\n\\nSo it should be quite fun.\\n\\nAnd yeah, it should be exciting as well in terms of hopefully some of you may have used Next.js before, but this is version 13, I believe.\\n\\nA few things have changed since I've last used it.\\n\\nSo I'll be learning a little bit as well as you guys.\\n\\nSo that's all good.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo before we even get started, I guess what am I going to do in terms of the actual planning stage I guess?\\n\\nThat's probably one of the first steps.\\n\\nI'm going to jump to my screen.\\n\\nThere you go.\\n\\nSo sometimes best to when you're starting to think of ideas and how you're going to do something, it's best to sort of whiteboard it.\\n\\nThis is about as close as I can get to a whiteboard on a stream.\\n\\nThis is freeform.\\n\\nSo let's chuck in, I guess, the title.\\n\\nWhat are we going to call it?\\n\\nGoing to be a LMS on Next.JS.\\n\\nLet me know in the chat if anything is hard to read as well.\\n\\nBecause I want everyone to be able to see it.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nOkay, so a couple of things that we're going to need for an LMS.\\n\\nWe're of course going to need the project so that's a given.\\n\\nBut we're actually going to need like a couple of things in terms of planning and that sort of things.\\n\\nSo let's put some of those together.\\n\\nWe could have, I notice a circle here.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nBring it to the front.\\n\\nOkay and we're going to need probably some wireframes.\\n\\nThat's probably a good place to start.\\n\\nWe're going to need some way of storing the actual data that's going to be part of the LMS.\\n\\nSo let's do that.\\n\\nSo we want to determine how we store data.\\n\\nOkay, um big thing, colour theme, really important.\\n\\nWe'll need that, colour theme.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nI guess Sort of be like I talked about before there will need to be some parts of it that are sort of sitting in the public and that can be indexed by Google and so we'll need public pages. This is just my big sort of my map of kind of how I'm gonna build it all. What else do we need we're gonna have logged in pages. Okay As soon as we say that we need to be logged in in some way We then we need to actually you know think about it in terms of what are we gonna use for authentication?\\n\\nWhat's it gonna be?\\n\\nWhat's the scope that can be made up of?\\n\\nDo we build?\\n\\nDo we use something that's off the shelf?\\n\\nIt's tricky.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nWhat else do we need?\\n\\nAnyone else?\\n\\nSo many ideas.\\n\\nThe chat.\\n\\nDo you think the communication we've got that some sort of data store?\\n\\nWe might need some sort of how the videos are managed.\\n\\nSo media.\\n\\nHow will that be handled?\\n\\nI guess what else do I want to have in it?\\n\\nWhat would be another good thing?\\n\\nI guess with a lot of LMSs you're going to need some authentication.\\n\\nYou might need different types of permissions.\\n\\nSo we're going to need some way to manage roles.\\n\\nSo I could see there could be different types of users.\\n\\nSo you could be someone-- maybe a student could be one type of role, and another role could be an admin or a course content editor that could be in different roles we'd need.\\n\\nLet's do that.\\n\\nSo what am I going to do for student?\\n\\nI might just call it content editor.\\n\\nMake it very generic.\\n\\nWhat else could we have?\\n\\nWe've got public pages.\\n\\nWe've got logged in pages.\\n\\nWe've got authentication.\\n\\nWe've got our roles.\\n\\nStudents, content editor, it's a way to have some data stored, how we're gonna handle media.\\n\\nA tutor for marking, yeah there could be another role with that a great one.\\n\\nWhat would that be?\\n\\nWhat would be a good name?\\n\\nSo it could be just Marker, I guess.\\n\\nWe'll keep it generic.\\n\\nWe can always change these later, of course.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nWhat How sort of people like to see in LMS?\\n\\nHow would the students maybe question something or how could they raise any issues?\\n\\nAny ideas?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nI'm thinking maybe they could have comments, so they could actually like comment on the video to make it, I guess, a bit more interactive there with people that are administrating the course.\\n\\nPlenty of LMSs of use in the past that they have some sort of comment system they could have a forum page.\\n\\nOh, we're starting to get feature group ready aren't we?\\n\\nThat's all good.\\n\\nWell I think that the tricky part is in anything when you're doing this is the scoping is you know basically fine tuning it down to what are things that you need to get started and we'll go after that.\\n\\nBut I think pretty much a comments thing would be easy to, well a basic comment because this I've got to be careful with it.\\n\\nNon-threaded comments would probably be fine, maybe on each sort of page that could work.\\n\\nWhat else?\\n\\nI've got Marker, I've got a Content Interact of Student, Communication.\\n\\nCool thing about authentication is it could be done in a couple of ways.\\n\\nSo in my head I'm thinking you could have just a traditional sort of email password, which is fine, absolutely, some people love it.\\n\\nBut we could also use a single sign-on, say like, authenticating with Google or LinkedIn, any of those sort of single sign-ons apps, that would be pretty good to be able to do that.\\n\\nSo I'll just leave it pretty blank at the moment, single sign on sounds like a good one.\\n\\nProbably leaning towards I guess a bit more professional LinkedIn maybe, which means that we could maybe do some cool sort of badges or something like that when they've finished a course or something like that.\\n\\nBut yeah that's something to think about in the future.\\n\\nYeah so we can have these.\\n\\nI think this is like probably the minimum I think that I'd like to launch with.\\n\\nYeah, it's looking pretty cool.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nI guess the tricky one I've kind of left off.\\n\\nCome to it later I think after the wireframes.\\n\\nThis choosing maybe you know build a UI library from scratch or use something that's already pre-tested and available already.\\n\\nIt's those cons and pros of trying to do all this stuff.\\n\\nCool okay I'm just start now so now I've got sort of some brainstorming I guess of what I plan to do save it for starters I'll rename it, there we go RMS brainstorm cool Sorry there.\\n\\nWireframes.\\n\\nI think that's where I'm gonna start.\\n\\ngoing to help get that visual sort of idea of what I want to do for my design there.\\n\\nI'm going to keep it pretty simple.\\n\\nI'm going to use something else.\\n\\nI could use this but I think I'll jump to Excalidraw just because it's nice and simple.\\n\\nI always forget how you create a new one.\\n\\nReset the canvas, that's one.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nAlright, okay cool.\\n\\nSo well, for starters this is going to be a responsive web app.\\n\\nSo I'm going to build it with a mind that I'm going to have sort of mobile sized screens and tablets and of course desktops.\\n\\nMake that look a bit narrower.\\n\\nLet's do that for a tablet.\\n\\nAnd of course the desktop.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nAny design I'm going to need to have, I guess, some sort of header or some sort of notification that the users can be able to navigate around.\\n\\nSo I'm just going to put something like this here.\\n\\nAgain these can be as rough as you want.\\n\\nSometimes having it low fidelity is great because it means that you're just going to not be limited kind of what going to be doing.\\n\\nSo that could be my nav up there.\\n\\nLet's do, that's my logo for now.\\n\\nAnd some sort of navigation.\\n\\nI just put a text label for now.\\n\\nI don't know if I put it as an icon or what.\\n\\nComic Sans.\\n\\nOkay, that's the one thing I don't like about.\\n\\nThere we go, about a Excalidraw.\\n\\nOkay, here.\\n\\nOf course this is gonna have a bit more room for menu items.\\n\\nOkay awesome.\\n\\nOkay so I've got you know basic navigation logos sort of here area it's gonna be consistent across the different sized screens there but I'm gonna have to actually make up a whole of different pages.\\n\\nSo I'm just gonna put a label beside this this is gonna be it's gonna be the home.\\n\\nThat's the kind of landing page that's gonna be a page that I want people to come to and be able to know sort of what they're coming to a site about, what's it going to try and get them to sign up, get them to see what's on offer and be able to do a course.\\n\\nSo what I could do is I'd have some sort of maybe hero image here which would then entice people to want to be able to take a look.\\n\\nSo I'm just going to do like a common thing is images is of course to have a cross-line for it to denote an image and have some sort of call to action, maybe call to action button or something like that that's going to get people to sign up Just keep it really rough.\\n\\nOk, so that's on a mobile screen, front and centre, right in that first section as they come to the app they're going to see what's on offer, hopefully a nice visual image explaining what's on offer, getting them to sign up.\\n\\nI'm going to want to do something similar for the tablet but I've got a little bit more room.\\n\\nSo what I could do rather than just have the one kind of image here.\\n\\nIs it option or is it control?\\n\\nI've got one there.\\n\\nI could do maybe two side by side that would make use of the extra room there.\\n\\nLet's see, let's set 50/50.\\n\\nOK.\\n\\nAll right, OK, so we've got sort of two by side by side now.\\n\\nWe've got a button here.\\n\\nAgain, of course, call to action.\\n\\nTrying to get people to sign up.\\n\\nMaybe start a course.\\n\\nsome of the courses may be initially free.\\n\\nI'm not quite sure yet.\\n\\nI haven't quite figured that plan out but that's definitely could be on the roadmap.\\n\\nAnd where's my selection tool?\\n\\nThere we go.\\n\\nI copied that.\\n\\nAnd for the next one I'm going to make it so that it is..\\n\\nI'm going to get three across at the moment.\\n\\nI might change my mind later.\\n\\nBut that's probably a good place to start.\\n\\nThere we go.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nAwesome.\\n\\nAwesome okay so home page, um, thinking, thinking MVP here, so MVP is either minimum viable product which I don't quite like that much.\\n\\nI prefer the minimum valuable product because the reality is people aren't going to use your stuff unless it's valuable to them.\\n\\nSo you want to make it not just viable, you want to make it so that people will actually want to sign up and pay money for it, so that's making it invaluable to them.\\n\\nOkay, so we've got those through there, sign up.\\n\\nI think the other thing I'll probably just put on for now is a footer, and I'll keep it pretty low key again, probably just some links I think in the bottom here.\\n\\nAgain, sort of placeholders, not really doing any fought to the content yet although I should at some point.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nI'm getting it in right click and.\\n\\nIs it just vertically?\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nTwo symbols.\\n\\nI'll leave the line there.\\n\\nCool, cool.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nImagine these would maybe be two columns on the tablet.\\n\\nmaybe two columns on the tablet maybe a third one down here.\\n\\nAnd sort of getting that flow of content.\\n\\nAnd of course with the mobile that's just going to stack.\\n\\nlike so.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nOkay, you know, starting to get things together, like what our home page would be.\\n\\nI guess the next step, you know, we've got that call to action there.\\n\\nWhat I could do instead, from the next step, I guess, would be to have maybe a sign-up page.\\n\\nSo let's do that.\\n\\nOne more.\\n\\nWhile I've got these I'm just gonna grab the header and I'm gonna try and get this all rapidly put together I'm not missing my Okay and of course I'm going to use these multiple times so I should probably um duplicate this.\\n\\nI'll not do what I've just done now which took forever.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nI don't care if this is a wonderful thing, when it copies properly.\\n\\nLet's try that again.\\n\\nI'll get everyone more.\\n\\nOkay so I've got my home, I'm going to sign up process.\\n\\nGenerally I'm gonna have a multitude of things I guess for a sign up process and especially one with a single sign up.\\n\\nSo what I'll do is a form, something like this and I'm gonna have my label, I'm gonna use email and I use password, the first option.\\n\\nAnd I'm gonna have options for.\\n\\nThat's the wrong way.\\n\\nSomething like that.\\n\\nHey Belinda, cool to have you on the stream.\\n\\nHopefully we'll get to next.\\n\\nWe might still be on the planning stages but that's okay.\\n\\nIt's a long process.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nOkay so I got my email address.\\n\\nI got my password.\\n\\nAnd I'm going to need a couple of buttons.\\n\\nFeeling like LinkedIn.\\n\\nLinkedIn, maybe.\\n\\nBecause this could be for a enterprise or work user as well, so.\\n\\nThey could have Microsoft and maybe.\\n\\nOkay, well, that might be a good subset.\\n\\nI'll single sign on.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nOkay, so thinking about it in terms of the users coming in, if they're looking on a mobile, well it probably would be nice to guess to have some more introduction sort of things.\\n\\nLet's kind of just skip straight to the point on my mobile screen and try to get them to fill in their details there or hit one of these buttons and go through that process of using the single sign-on.\\n\\nSo what are we going to have different on a tablet?\\n\\nSo I should probably have my label here.\\n\\nAnd I'll try and copy, I want to reuse it because I don't want to have to start completely from scratch.\\n\\nI'm going to put that to the right and I think the ratio is quite right but the why to sign up.\\n\\nSo why would someone want to actually to do that have that there on the page so they come in on a bigger screen they'd see that but they'd also have course this on the mobile it's just that it's not going to be easily visible I guess above the fold there.\\n\\nSo we still have it, we just have it a bit lower down.\\n\\nMake it a bit more square.\\n\\nSo desktop is next and again I can probably use a lot of what I've already got for the some tablet sort of size.\\n\\nI can play around with my ratios a bit more.\\n\\nI've got a bit more room to breathe.\\n\\nPotential here to have a nice hero image.\\n\\nWhat are the benefits, features or something like that.\\n\\nCould be as an image or it could be as text.\\n\\nNot quite sure yet.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSign up.\\n\\nThat's done.\\n\\nOf course when you have a sign up you're also going to need some sort of login.\\n\\nI want to have this, the reason I've just not haven't done a lot on the sign up process is I don't want actually too much of a barrier there to get them first in the door.\\n\\nIdeally as being a, I guess, a potential student user, try to collect the minimum amount of information as possible.\\n\\nSo maybe email, password, I can take them to a profile page later and they can fill in those kind of details.\\n\\nSo I'll just try and keep it super simple and the other cool thing about this is if I have it very simple like this I can actually reuse it.\\n\\nI can use this for my login as well.\\n\\nSometimes we want to take some shortcuts.\\n\\nAgain this is a MVP but I'm trying to build.\\n\\nIt's not gonna be all singing and dancing yet but it's really good to try So try and be mindful of how you can sort of do things and not take too much time.\\n\\nOkay so let's do that.\\n\\nSign up.\\n\\nI guess probably the two most important pages of an LMS is going to be the actual, I guess like an overview page of what the course is.\\n\\nAnd then secondly, the actual each detail.\\n\\nSo design a detail page for the course content there.\\n\\nAnd that course content could be text, could be video, it could be PDFs to download, it could be potentially a survey or a questionnaire.\\n\\nmaybe some things to think about in the future.\\n\\nBut if we want to think about this in terms of, I guess, any VP side of things, probably the most common thing with an LMS would be my text, and maybe a video.\\n\\nHaving those two, I think, would be a good starting point.\\n\\nSo let's have one of these labels.\\n\\nSorry, what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do what I call it.\\n\\nNamely things is hard, really hard.\\n\\nSo we've got a course overview.\\n\\nThere we go.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nStart with that.\\n\\nCourse overview and if they're going to be able to see basically a list.\\n\\nKey things that they're going to be wanting to be able to see of course is their progress so that they can come back to it later.\\n\\nSo this could be cross section and we're going to have to indicate in some way what they have and haven't done.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\n[ Pause ] I'm going to make it a little bit easier to see.\\n\\nAlright.\\n\\nUm, am I going to change it for the desktop and my bar, and the tablet, sorry?\\n\\nProbably?\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nI guess we could just have more content to be honest.\\n\\nWe could have a bigger description.\\n\\nSo what I'm going to do is just stretch these out a little bit.\\n\\nAnd I can do the same on the disk top and have some description of course or something.\\n\\nI just realised I lost more than this.\\n\\nNot again.\\n\\nMight actually make this stick.\\n\\nI might actually make this stacked.\\n\\nI'll do the same.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nSo, description.\\n\\nlike that, like that.\\n\\nLike so, cool.\\n\\nProbably what other two minimum screens I can need?\\n\\nI need a the actual details itself of the actual course, so I'll need to represent that in some way so we've got some idea of what we're actually going to need.\\n\\nSo literally I could see it being, it will have the section title and then we'll have either text blocks or video.\\n\\nDoes this have scallops on?\\n\\nNo it doesn't.\\n\\nNot particularly great but it'll help I guess get our understanding of what we're actually trying to do.\\n\\nWe're on top of the block I think it has to be a let's make it look like a block.\\n\\nYeah something like that.\\n\\nLeft align.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nAlright, so we've got our section, we'll probably have a video of some sort.\\n\\nI'm just going to sort of represent it somewhere like this.\\n\\nIt doesn't have to be too great, it just has to look like something.\\n\\nI'll recognise when I come back to it and go, what was that that I was trying to draw?\\n\\nThere you go.\\n\\nAnd maybe another black text box underneath that.\\n\\nAnd of course we talked about it before going back to my map.\\n\\nI talked about comments.\\n\\nSo I will add comment block on the bottom.\\n\\nI know someone like that maybe.\\n\\nVery rough.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nI don't know if I'll actually do it anything different for the tablet.\\n\\nUm.\\n\\nAnd then again, for the desktop, I don't know if I'll do it that much different too.\\n\\nInstead I'd probably just make use of the area to actually have a bigger area for viewing the video.\\n\\nSo let's do that.\\n\\nThis one needs to be in print.\\n\\nI'll just use my crew drawing.\\n\\nThe number one thing with a wireframe is that you want it to be relatively quick to put together, and the second thing is that you want it to at least be recognisable so that when you show it to someone else they would actually hopefully understand what you're trying to do.\\n\\nOkay, cool.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nOkay, so I've got a course overview.\\n\\nThis will be my course detail.\\n\\nThat weird some weird artifact there.\\n\\nI was sure that was.\\n\\nAnd I'm going to put this here.\\n\\nCourse detail.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nAlright, okay, cool.\\n\\nAnd so I've got those, I've got my layout, I've got my course detail, I've got my course overview.\\n\\nSign up page and slash login page and a home page.\\n\\nI guess the next kind of, what is probably the minimum.\\n\\nAgain because I'm doing this as an MVP, it won't have all the nice admin that it plays yet.\\n\\nThis will be, initially we'll just have it so that it's in a format which I can edit it.\\n\\nSo it can be a bit more technical.\\n\\nAnd if it's making some entries in a database tool, that's fine.\\n\\nOK, alright.\\n\\nOK, I'm happy with that.\\n\\nI'm going to save that.\\n\\nI always forget what to do.\\n\\nHere we go, save.\\n\\nI'm going to save it as a, I'm going to save it to disk.\\n\\nI'll put it into my downloads.\\n\\nThese aren't of course finished, this is just getting to a point where I think we've got something to start with.\\n\\nI bet you're all itching to sort of kick off the project and see how that goes.\\n\\nOkay, a few more steps I've got to do along the way.\\n\\nComing back to our brainstorming.\\n\\nSo what could we have initially?\\n\\nWhat I'm going to do is I'm just going to circle what I think I can actually, I guess, can get away with as doing for my MVP.\\n\\nI'll just use that tool.\\n\\nIt's a bit big.\\n\\nSo I could get away with having just the role for a student potentially.\\n\\nWhat else could I get away with?\\n\\nI could potentially just have email password as your authentication and then add the single sign on later.\\n\\nWhat else do?\\n\\nWhat can I get away with?\\n\\nWell, I've done the wireframes, I've done that.\\n\\nWe're not going to be escape this one to determine how we store data because that's pretty important.\\n\\nView authentication, again that's going to be important.\\n\\nLogged in pages, definitely.\\n\\nAnd public pages.\\n\\nOkay so what would I store?\\n\\nProbably the key thing out there as well that I also need.\\n\\nI've got nothing there really talking about the course structure so what do I need?\\n\\nI'm just gonna call it data and from this point I'm gonna need the, I need to see the course, so there will be a course, so it will be the parent, it will have a child of course details, I have a course section, have a child of course section and it will also need the course media which I could probably break up into two things which would be some text, markdown maybe, so the actual content for a section and the other could be media.\\n\\nI didn't make it videos because I want to make this kind of generic, some media could have a type of video, maybe a type of image, probably is one MVP sort of sort of things.\\n\\nSo I'll put those labels there to that so that we don't forget that.\\n\\nUm so image and video.\\n\\nI think that's kind of the minimums that I can get away with here.\\n\\nand start drawing some lines to stuff so it makes it a bit easier to come back to when we're talking about.\\n\\nOK, a couple more.\\n\\nYou can't move it easily.\\n\\nAlright cool.\\n\\nCourse media, course text.\\n\\nMarkdown.\\n\\nThere we go.\\n\\nCool, so that's like the actual core things of what people are actually going to view or read or watch.\\n\\nThey're going to need to of course then have a comments attached to it.\\n\\nSo, I'll do another one.\\n\\nI'll probably attach the.\\n\\nDo I attach the comments to the media?\\n\\nOr should I attach the contents.\\n\\nThe comments, sorry.\\n\\nTo the section?\\n\\nI'm gonna keep it quite high level, so I think I'll keep it to the section.\\n\\nAnd that will be a mini to iron.\\n\\nOkay, how are we looking?\\n\\nOkay, comments, data.\\n\\nThis is kind of one of my key areas, is the data course, course section, course media, comments, text mark down, media, image and video.\\n\\nIt's a little confusing.\\n\\nI'm just going to drop these.\\n\\nAnd wrap it.\\n\\nIs that a type for media?\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nComments.\\n\\nGot that covered.\\n\\nGot some form of student.\\n\\nstudents can need some sort of profile.\\n\\nThinking of it as the MVP, I might try and get away without having any details yet.\\n\\nBut what I probably can't get away with is the student's progress.\\n\\nThat's really important, they need to be able to see what they've actually looked at and when they come back to the LMS they're going to be able to see you know what the actual what section they got up to and yeah we want to be able to just take them straight back into it and not have to navigate around obviously as well.\\n\\nThis would be sweet for it.\\n\\nI'm just making school course progress.\\n\\nSo that's progress.\\n\\nThat's going to be attached to the student.\\n\\nIt's pretty cool student progress and I'm going to make a table for student I think as well.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nAll right, so we've got student, got the progress, that's going to be attached to the course.\\n\\nStudent progress course, course section, course media.\\n\\nThis is definitely not a database diagram.\\n\\nenrollment then of course.\\n\\nOoh I like that Belinda, that's a good one.\\n\\nSo I don't need a student progress.\\n\\nMaybe I can have a course enrollment table.\\n\\n[silence] multiple enrollment records with the student's name in it.\\n\\nOr ID.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nThis very much looks like I'm already going down the path of a sort of relationship style database.\\n\\nSo I think that's kind of a given so far.\\n\\nIt's not probably a little bit more.\\n\\nI mean you could do this with something like MongoDB, but I'm thinking I will probably use Postgres for this.\\n\\nSo that would be cool.\\n\\nSo we've made a decision I think.\\n\\nThat's good.\\n\\nAgain with this brainstorming.\\n\\nSo I've talked about that.\\n\\nThat's kind of to determine what I'm going to store.\\n\\nComments, kind of got that in the data now so I might just leave that for now.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nLet's do that.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo we're starting to get like a key list of actual requirements now for the project.\\n\\nKey ones being I need to be able to have some authentication system.\\n\\nIt's going to need some roles in the future.\\n\\nIt's going to need a somewhere to map that to maybe a relational database where I can have the parent and children relationships not only for the course but those that are enrolled into it, their progress, comments, the course media, so there's going to be a parent and child relationship around that as well and I think that's the core parts I think that I can get away with.\\n\\nYep.\\n\\nOkay, cool.\\n\\nSo I need something that's going to be able to do authentication and database.\\n\\nThere could be two different things.\\n\\nI could use two different services.\\n\\nI could have a Docker image running Postgres and I could use potentially something like Octa for sort of authentication there.\\n\\nOcta or Off Zero, having its little baby brother.\\n\\nAlternatively, there's one thing that's coming to my mind that could do both.\\n\\nAnd actually also hopefully save us some time.\\n\\nHow do you know these things?\\n\\nThis is the hard part, is basically you don't unless you've been searching out there for this kind of stuff.\\n\\nIt's like how would you know what to even search for?\\n\\nBut you could just like 4-0 of course.\\n\\n4-0 is basically your identification platform.\\n\\nSo it's got the ability there to do all the, just like we want there, email password and continue with either sort of like Google or Office or like I've talked about LinkedIn as well.\\n\\nThere's definitely something I could do.\\n\\nAnd on the database side, I could just use Postgres database.\\n\\nI could use maybe You can see here there's Amazon advertising there on that sponsored link for having a SQL Postgres database that's hosted on Amazon and it's a database as a service.\\n\\nAgain, got the actual Postgres site.\\n\\nI know of another thing that would be quite beneficial.\\n\\nAnd that would be Superbase.\\n\\nSo what I try to think about is, Firebase would probably be more similar to something like Mongo and it allows you to have a communication system, data structure and even things like being able to have storage on that side of things.\\n\\nSo, media.\\n\\nWe can do the same with Superbase and Superbase is very similar to Firebase.\\n\\nAs you know, that's something here.\\n\\ndatabase is an open source Firebase alternative and the cool thing about it, it's got a nice integration of Next.js.\\n\\nCheck, that's what we're going to be using.\\n\\nIt's got authentication.\\n\\nIt's got a database that's relational.\\n\\nCool, so everyone is probably familiar with a relational database, a SQL database.\\n\\nPostgres one is a great open source solution.\\n\\nAgain, it's got storage so we could store things like videos and images.\\n\\nThat probably suits us nicely.\\n\\nOkay, cool.\\n\\nSo I think we've made some decisions around that that we could, you know, we've got the ability there to do our authentication.\\n\\nSo let's double check to make sure that we're going to be able to do some sort of single sign-on to have LinkedIn.\\n\\nHow can I find that out?\\n\\nGood question.\\n\\nLet's go into the documentation.\\n\\nEnterprise, single sign on, social login.\\n\\nYes, okay so we've got LinkedIn, we've got Google, we've got Microsoft, whereas you're using Slack, which actually, that could be quite a good one too.\\n\\nAwesome.\\n\\nAwesome okay so those that's all great that's social login that's going to be perfect we've got the ability to do logon with email again that's looking perfect for what we need maybe we've got a quick start there for next so we'll probably jump into this soon probably not today And what else do we need?\\n\\nWe needed to look at it in terms of database.\\n\\nSo I know that for a fact that Superbase actually also has a quite nice editing tool that's all web-based as well.\\n\\nSo you can administer your site I guess while you're in that sort of early stages before you have I guess a full-blown actual interface there that people would be able to manage content in.\\n\\nLike I said in the whiteboarding here, let's try and keep it down to the minimum here.\\n\\nWe want to try and get this out on launch so try to minimize your scope is a good way of doing that.\\n\\nOkay, alright so I'm feeling pretty happy about that.\\n\\nI think Superbase seems to be covering quite a few of my options.\\n\\nCommunication, so it's got an SQL editor here, it's got a table view editor.\\n\\nSo I've technically got a very basic admin that I can use at least to get started to be able to add content, to add videos and sort of get started there, which is pretty cool.\\n\\nAnd another normal thing that anyone will question of course is price.\\n\\nalways a good question to sort of ask.\\n\\nLet's look at pricing here.\\n\\nWe've got a zero dollar.\\n\\nLooks like it's social auth providers.\\n\\nSo we've got, it's quite generous I think that 500 megs, that should be fine.\\n\\nProbably not so much on the file storage at 1 gig, the video's big, but you can start off there at least and get going.\\n\\nAnd you can have 50,000 monthly active users.\\n\\nI wish I could have 50,000 monthly active users.\\n\\nIt's more than could expect.\\n\\nSo that's probably good in terms of getting up and running fast.\\n\\nNext on the list.\\n\\nHow's it gonna look?\\n\\nThis is a tricky one.\\n\\nI could of course go and make a full custom CSS theme layout that's probably going to be quite slow to get started.\\n\\nIt'll take me quite a long time to build our component library and it's actually really hard to beat something that's already pre-configured.\\n\\nSo even if you think about Tailwind even, you know, in terms of development speed, it's still going to make you a little bit faster there because you're not sort of starting from scratch completely.\\n\\nBut I'll probably take it one step further again while I'll be able to have a lot of freedom in terms of customisation with something like Tailwind.\\n\\nI'll show you what I mean by that.\\n\\nThere's actually another article, there's a couple articles about Tailwind on my own website as well.\\n\\nIf you want to have a look Tail and what is Tail in CSS?\\n\\nSo I've got a brief introduction about what it's all about.\\n\\nWell worth checking out if you would like to see that.\\n\\nLet's check it into the chat.\\n\\nOkay, it's great.\\n\\nI mean like I have used T quite a few times in the past, but it ends up meaning instead of having to write all our CSS out like this, we end up with it.\\n\\nAll the CSS classes are already pre-configured and we just apply them to our components and react.\\n\\nNot bad, it's gonna be quite quick but it's still gonna require us to make all the sort of controls, form elements, things like because we're gonna need a login form so we're gonna need some sort of password field, input field.\\n\\nWe'll probably need some nice text area of some sort to be able to do a comments for the users to be able to add comments.\\n\\nWe're gonna need buttons of some sort, whether that be to enroll in a course or sign up on a form or that kind of thing.\\n\\nNavigation, that's another thing we probably want to have.\\n\\nWe build that from scratch.\\n\\nIt's not far wrong with doing that.\\n\\nJust time, time is our enemy I guess.\\n\\nWhen you're building anything from this for yourself, there's only sort of one person, so you can only, you know, you want to sort of maximize your time being able to build things a bit faster.\\n\\nAnd I could use a whole range of sort of UI libraries.\\n\\nThere's MUI which is the material UI which uses React components.\\n\\nThere's Chakra, Ant Design.\\n\\nThere's just a couple off top my head.\\n\\nThere's a version of Bootstrap that's built with React components.\\n\\nBut a new one that I've really liked the look of and again the other great thing about it is that it prioritizes accessibility.\\n\\nIt's the Radix UI.\\n\\nSo why would I want to use something like this?\\n\\nWell you can see just from the sort of layout here if you look at the like playgrounds you know you've got a whole lot of input controls, you've got switches, you've got cards, you've got you know drop down components that kind of thing, nice little icons, what else, okay even like slider controls, not sure how to use that one but yeah there's even like a little play button there, might be something like that of course for our videos.\\n\\nSo it's quite a well-designed sort of theme I guess.\\n\\nIt's got the ability there to sort of have some customization where you can switch it already from light to dark.\\n\\nIt's got the ability for aspect ratios, avatars.\\n\\nBlock codes, a whole lot of colour theming, buttons of course, what else, all outs there, Like I said, being able to have all this stuff all ready to go is nice.\\n\\nUmm, cheap boxes.\\n\\nCode even.\\n\\nThat's good.\\n\\nA menu.\\n\\nThat's pretty slick.\\n\\nSo you've got some awesome sort of ability to do a lot of this stuff out of the box without having to build it from scratch.\\n\\nAnother cool thing about this Radix library, I believe it's got really good accessibility.\\n\\nSo that's another, again, another thing that's going to also speed up time and sort of development.\\n\\nYou know, trying to make your website accessible is a really important part of building anything these days.\\n\\nThey say that somewhere between 5 and 20% of people have some sort of disability of some sort.\\n\\nAnd that's pretty big numbers and that can be ranging from everything from cognitive So maybe ADHD could be low sight, so there's a lot of macular deterioration of where people cannot see things that's easily in the centre of their vision.\\n\\nColour blindness, there's all sorts.\\n\\nAnd it's really nice to be able to have something that's already got a lot of that done for you.\\n\\nSo again, this theme's got icons, it's got quite a large big icon set, it's got colours, you know, you can use these colour schemes, and it's also got, these are primitives as well, so you've also got the ability there to I guess make some custom elements if need which is quite nice.\\n\\nWhich is cool.\\n\\nDocumentation wise, accessibility there, it's very much on the top level there.\\n\\nAgain, I've got accessible labels, keyboard navigation, focus management, it's all built on there, keyboard navigation is there.\\n\\nSo that's a great in terms of being able to build this web app.\\n\\nSo going back to our whiteboard, we've got I guess a stack.\\n\\nLet's put like a list together of what our stack's going to be.\\n\\nNow I've already chosen the Xjs.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nI'm familiar with it.\\n\\nIt's React and it's very popular.\\n\\nIt's got the ability to also do server-side rendering and client-side rendering, which is going to be of course important for things like public pages where they need to be indexed by something like Google.\\n\\nSo next JS, we're going to have a Radix for our UI.\\n\\nWe're gonna use Superbase and that's gonna be OOF and that's gonna be DV.\\n\\nOkay, hosting we'll worry about later.\\n\\nI guess the one other cool thing is the videos.\\n\\nIt's storage media.\\n\\nWe'll put Superbase down for the time being.\\n\\nI'm not sure if it's going to be cost effective in that area but we can sort that out.\\n\\nBut there you've got a full stack app that will be built with Thanks.\\n\\njs, so we'll be able to build APIs or interfacing with Superbase anyway.\\n\\nWe'll be able to render things server-side and client-side.\\n\\nThe key thing about the client-side side of things is that we want to be able to track things like people's progress and eventually have some sort of interaction or some core sort whether that be you know questionnaires surveys that kind of thing so again it's leaning towards a a view library like React or Angular or View so that's kind of where we're looking at in terms of stack and again next why I'm using that is because it is it's react based and I'm comfortable with react sometimes it's good to work with something you know see what's up rendering Okay, awesome.\\n\\nOkay, so I think that's, we're at 230 now.\\n\\nI'm gonna stop I think for now.\\n\\nBut from, I guess from the next, our next session, we will jump into more of us planning, getting this tech stack set up.\\n\\nset up and of course starting to do something like a cam bam board or some sort where we can actually break up sort of all the work that needs to be done.\\n\\nSo thank you everyone that's been watching my stream.\\n\\nPlease like and subscribe to my channel.\\n\\nYou'll get notifications of course when the next live streams are coming up.\\n\\nI'm going to try and do about four streams a week, that's the goal, as time permits.\\n\\nSo I will post those as soon as I know.\\n\\nI've got Robbie asking, \\\"Have you ever added 'Would it be difficult to add next-gen to an existing project?\\n\\nIt depends.\\n\\nI would probably instead do it the other way around, start the Next.\\n\\njs project and if you

This is part 7 of the series. I am continuing a project with an LMS (Learning Management System) using the Storybook.js, Superbase, and Radix UI. So far, I have set up a header component and am working on building other components in isolation using the storybook. The LMS project is in its early stages with a homepage set up and another page for listing data. The Superbase database is connected, with a few tables for courses and students. The next step is to work with Radix components.\\n\\nThe project is available on GitHub as LMS NextJS.\\n\\nCheck out the documentation on Radix UI components for more information.\\n\\nyoutube.com/embed/EXvU7F1D59o?si=8kM1Zl-k5_MIjtDG\\n\\n---\\n\\nAll right, hi there.\\n\\nI'm back.\\n\\nIt's been a while, I know.\\n\\nSo I'm going to be back continuing this project with our LMS using the storybook.js, Superbase, and Radix UI.\\n\\nSo just to recap of where we got to, we have a component here.\\n\\nOkay, so we got our header component.\\n\\nBasically, that's all we've got set up at the moment in our project.\\n\\nWe're trying to build our components in isolation using the storybook.\\n\\nAnd in storybook, we will flesh out all our components that we can use, but in that sort of the layout, the stuff that's going to be reused as much as possible.\\n\\nSo that includes things like the buttons, the header, photo, et cetera, that kind of stuff.\\n\\nNothing that's real, I guess, layout specific.\\n\\nOkay, so what have we done so far with the LMS?\\n\\nNot a lot.\\n\\nWe've got a homepage.\\n\\nI think we've got one other page where we're listing out some data.\\n\\nWe've got Superbase connected up to it.\\n\\nWe've got a couple of tables.\\n\\nWe've got courses.\\n\\nWe've got students and some supplementary tables around those too.\\n\\nOkay, so if you haven't been keeping up, might pay to have a look at the project.\\n\\nI'm just going to paste that into the chat.\\n\\nOkay, so that should come up shortly.\\n\\nAnd if not, it should be part of the description as well.\\n\\nWhat I'm going to do next is try and get some of these Radix components, wrap them in our own layers so that we can manipulate them how we would like to use them, and try and get those set up and ready.\\n\\nSo let's jump into Chrome and I can show you that.\\n\\nOkay, so that's the project there.\\n\\nWe've got the LMS, just the actual dev environment there, localhost 3000.\\n\\nSo not much to see there.\\n\\nWe've got some next one component that I'm going to make.\\n\\nI'm going to make a button and I'm going to give it the options to have a icon as well.\\n\\nSo I'll set that up shortly.\\n\\nWe've got our wireframes.\\n\\nSo we've got our homepage there, sign up, course overview, course detail.\\n\\nOkay, so that's all we've got so far.\\n\\nWe've got a storybook and we've got Superbase.\\n\\nCool, okay.\\n\\nLet's get started.\\n\\nWe'll start off with this button.\\n\\nEasy way to get started is I'm literally going to copy this example code and I'm going to place that into our project.\\n\\nLet's switch to code.\\n\\nOkay, so I'm going to create a new component and this is going to be button.\\n\\nI'm going to keep it generic like so.\\n\\nAnd we need to actually import that from the Redex UI.\\n\\nNow I don't know what that is off the top of my head.\\n\\nI'm just going to grab that from the website, view the source.\\n\\nI want to import from Redex here.\\n\\nI believe it's button.\\n\\nRedex UI themes there.\\n\\nCool, let's come up.\\n\\nAwesome, and we'll import the icons as well.\\n\\nActually we won't.\\n\\nWe want to make that a property that we can add to the component so that the person using that component can easily style as necessary.\\n\\nOkay, we're going to make this a button.\\n\\nI'm just going to prefix all my components so it's obvious which ones are pre-built and which ones are my own.\\n\\nAnd I'm going to move this up until I return there.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nReturn like that.\\n\\nWhat help if I may have used the right brackets there?\\n\\nOkay, so I'm going to drop out this component here.\\n\\nNow we'll make that an input.\\n\\nSo this could be the icon.\\n\\nSo we're going to need a title and an icon like so.\\n\\nOkay, so it's super basic.\\n\\nWe're taking a title and we're taking the icon.\\n\\nIcon can be provided, which is awesome.\\n\\nWe need to actually have a story for that so that we can actually display that.\\n\\nSo I'm going to grab the header one to get started.\\n\\nThere's a boilerplate.\\n\\nJust remember I've got my alien mess button in front of it.\\n\\nI don't know what I've done wrong already.\\n\\nI did not name this correctly.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nKeep forgetting it's the other way around.\\n\\nSo that's the component itself.\\n\\nThere is this is the name that's going to be there and the both the URL and in our storybook.\\n\\nLet's check.\\n\\nLooks like storybooks has built.\\n\\nLet's switch back to Chrome.\\n\\nOkay, let's go to our storybook.\\n\\nRefresh this.\\n\\nOkay, now we can see we've got an LMS button there.\\n\\nWe've got a problem.\\n\\nThat's okay.\\n\\nWe'll figure that in a sec.\\n\\nSo it's missing a default export there.\\n\\nSo probably on my component itself, I'm missing that default export.\\n\\nLet's go back to Chrome.\\n\\nSorry, to VS Code.\\n\\nOkay, so I've got my default there.\\n\\nLike so.\\n\\nOkay, switch back to Chrome.\\n\\nRefresh that.\\n\\nObjects not valid as a React child object with keys.\\n\\nObjects are not valid for child key if you're meant to render collection of children using array instead.\\n\\nI'm not getting any errors here.\\n\\nSo what do we got?\\n\\nWe've got our title.\\n\\nWe've got our icon.\\n\\nWe've got our button.\\n\\nThat should be fine.\\n\\nDo we need to have this wrapped in some braces?\\n\\nThat's where I went wrong.\\n\\nOkay, so back on Chrome.\\n\\nWe can see I've got a button there.\\n\\nIt's got my title at the moment.\\n\\nSo I can actually add some parameters to this in a sec.\\n\\nYou can see that there is a button.\\n\\nIt's not very looking very nice.\\n\\nWe need to install the providers here for the UI.\\n\\nOkay, so we've got the button there.\\n\\nWe've got the title.\\n\\nAnd our default arguments here.\\n\\nWe can give the title.\\n\\nI can give a default one now.\\n\\nLet's just keep that for now.\\n\\nSo back to.\\n\\nThere we go.\\n\\nThat's the button.\\n\\nIs the code.\\n\\nWe've got that default value on there.\\n\\nOkay, so if you're showing the code, what do we see there?\\n\\nWe've got the elements button and we've got a title.\\n\\nSo we can update this on the fly.\\n\\nThis is the real reason we want to use something like Storybook.\\n\\nBecause we can do this as we change it.\\n\\nThen we get that sort of real time view there.\\n\\nSo we get that actually looking like it's supposed to.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nNext steps.\\n\\nOkay, so we've got that working.\\n\\nIt seems I've got some problems with my audio here.\\n\\nNo, it's not tweaking.\\n\\nSorry.\\n\\nI had the mic.\\n\\nI had an off screen so I couldn't see that.\\n\\nBump that up so I can see really important.\\n\\nBe able to hear me.\\n\\nOkay, so we've got the elements button there.\\n\\nWe've got the here.\\n\\nOkay, let's keep going.\\n\\nSo this button is going to need more than that.\\n\\nAnd it's at the moment, it's not actually getting these Radix themes coming back through.\\n\\nWe look at what is in the actual documentation here.\\n\\nWe can see we've actually got quite a few more properties and stuff that we can add to it, which will do in a sec.\\n\\nBut the problem is we're not able to see the fact that it's getting the styling there from the theme.\\n\\nOkay, so what are we missing here?\\n\\nLet's find out.\\n\\nLet's go back into the code.\\n\\nSorry.\\n\\nSo if we're looking at this, this is the button.\\n\\nSee here as child size variant will pull this very sick, shortly, and we've got the code here.\\n\\nSo let's jump to that.\\n\\nNow, why is it not getting our theming?\\n\\nWhat's wrong?\\n\\nOkay, so we look at the app itself.\\n\\nWe've got a page layout.\\n\\nOkay, so we're not even getting that.\\n\\nSo we we lay out here now it could be because we're missing this theme part of Radix UI themes in our components here.\\n\\nSo let's actually test that we can test that by grabbing the Radix UI themes here.\\n\\nI'm just going to grab this initially and see if it's just a CSS.\\n\\nIt's not that we'll also add the theme as well.\\n\\nOkay, switch back to Chrome.\\n\\nSorry.\\n\\nIt's not just that we're going to have to also have the theme in there, I guess, as well.\\n\\nSo let's go into code again.\\n\\nAnd we also that was on the page was not always a layout layout.\\n\\nI need the theme need to put this in our story rather than.\\n\\nAnd here.\\n\\nOkay, so the theme.\\n\\nAnd we can just wrap this component like so.\\n\\nSee if this works.\\n\\nWe're going to have to make a wrapper of some sort.\\n\\nOkay, so expected a string.\\n\\nOkay, so we can't get away with that.\\n\\nWe're going to have to look at how we can do that to our store a box so that we can actually get those values in there.\\n\\nLet's undo that.\\n\\nIt's a little bit trickier.\\n\\nWe can test our theme styling potentially by placing it into the layout here.\\n\\nActually, I'll do it into the page because we've got the home there.\\n\\nLet's put our button in the title.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nSo it's fine once it's in the actual application when it's wrapped in that theme.\\n\\nLet's try and do the same with our storybook.\\n\\nA couple of ways we might maybe we can do that we can actually have a look to see if they're using storybook and the project or Radix.\\n\\nThat might be able to help us.\\n\\nSo you've got a playground here.\\n\\nSo that just wraps that there.\\n\\nOkay, so the provider.\\n\\nOkay, so we can't use that.\\n\\nLike we're not the only ones that have had the same issue.\\n\\nWhat a day time.\\n\\nNo, styling at all.\\n\\nOkay, that's looking like what we need.\\n\\nWe can add a theme provider.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nAwesome.\\n\\nOkay, let's go back to the top here.\\n\\nFirst of all, we are on Starbucks seven I believe.\\n\\nLet's double check that.\\n\\nYes, 7.\\n\\nOkay, so let's go back to code.\\n\\nStop the storybook.\\n\\nContinue with the idea here.\\n\\nGo to the alternative.\\n\\nThis is not yarn.\\n\\nOkay, so let's edit that to our storybook.\\n\\nNow we need to go and update.\\n\\nSo we've added that we've got once installed, open your storybook main.js file and add the storybook.\\n\\nAdd the storybook add on styling and the add owns array.\\n\\nGot stories.\\n\\nLet's open up our code again.\\n\\nNow we're set the configuration file.\\n\\nSome dots to report mean.\\n\\nOkay, so add owns there.\\n\\nBack in our code here, we've got our add on styling now.\\n\\nAnd save that.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nCome back to Chrome.\\n\\nOkay, so we've added our add on there.\\n\\nWe need to provide global styles next.\\n\\nIf your global styles are defined in CSS files, you can import your style sheets in the storybook preview.js file.\\n\\nStorybook load any files imported here on every story render.\\n\\nThat sounds like us.\\n\\nSo let's look for this dot storybook preview dot JS.\\n\\nAnd we'll just sneak ahead.\\n\\nHere we go.\\n\\nSo we could wrap this potentially in our theme provider.\\n\\nOkay, so what I'm going to do.\\n\\nGrab that line.\\n\\nAnd I'll grab the next one.\\n\\nHey, let's go back to code.\\n\\nPreview.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo we want to import the theme for red X.\\n\\nOh, that's going to put the theme there.\\n\\nWe probably will have to import the CSS.\\n\\nBut let's stop that.\\n\\nAnd now let's let's look at what's next in our preview.\\n\\nSo there was a need for decorators.\\n\\nSo do we have any decorators?\\n\\nNo, we don't have any decorators.\\n\\nAnd to put this theme here.\\n\\nHey.\\n\\nOkay, so we we've actually got quite some culture controls here.\\n\\nWe've actually got the ability here to see the background color, which is fine for now.\\n\\nWe just leave it like that.\\n\\nWe've set up this theme provider.\\n\\nSo hopefully that will work.\\n\\nLet's run our storybook again.\\n\\nSo far so good.\\n\\nLet's switch back to Chrome.\\n\\nWe've got a storybook here.\\n\\nRefresh.\\n\\nWith theme from J6 provider.\\n\\nSo probably have to pull that in from storybook itself.\\n\\nWould it be under blocks?\\n\\nLet's see if that.\\n\\nGot our theme from J6 provider.\\n\\nThat's still not working.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nOkay, so what do we need?\\n\\nWhat are we missing?\\n\\nGot the Radix theme there.\\n\\nGot this decorators.\\n\\nDo we actually have to supply that?\\n\\nActions, controls.\\n\\nDecorators.\\n\\nWe did it wrong.\\n\\nIt's still potentially just edit under here.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nHmm.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nGot a react tab.\\n\\nGot some HTML.\\n\\nGot the storybook being pulled in.\\n\\nWe've got a source here.\\n\\nSo we've got the app.\\n\\nWe're using, this is using style components.\\n\\nThis is not.\\n\\nDoes not seem to be using.\\n\\nWhat I expected it to be.\\n\\nThat's no good.\\n\\nOkay, so let's look into.\\n\\nLet's get back to this.\\n\\nAh, here we go.\\n\\nThis is probably where I've gone wrong.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nIt's tricky when you're trying to learn something new.\\n\\nOkay, let's get back up to the top here.\\n\\nWhat do we got?\\n\\nWe're getting the theme.\\n\\nOkay, from the red X UI.\\n\\nWe're not getting the theme provided from the right component.\\n\\nWhat that should be is with theme provider should be embraces starters.\\n\\nAnd this comes from instead add on.\\n\\nThat's that styling there.\\n\\nThere we go.\\n\\nOkay, nice.\\n\\nOkay, so done that.\\n\\nWe've got our decorators down here.\\n\\nWe've got our global styles.\\n\\nSo this is what we should be pulling in for our CSS.\\n\\nNow we've got that happening in our layout, I believe.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo let's pull that in and turn to our story.\\n\\nSorry, wrong one again.\\n\\nIt's our config for storybook, which is our main.\\n\\njs.\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nSo, sorry, getting it all wrong.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nMaybe I have to make it a constant.\\n\\nOkay, let's make that work.\\n\\nSo take that base style.\\n\\nPipe that into the global styles.\\n\\nOkay, and then we can add our themes.\\n\\nThat same component.\\n\\nOkay, so we've got that theme.\\n\\nWe're pulling that into our story here.\\n\\nAnd we've also got the themes there.\\n\\nWe've also got.\\n\\nWe don't actually need this.\\n\\nWe can just use the actual provider.\\n\\nAnd that is our theme.\\n\\nWe're just going to use the default one.\\n\\nAnd let's get rid of that.\\n\\nOkay, so decorators with theme provider from JSX provider global styles face.\\n\\nLet's go back to our storybook.\\n\\nOkay, so what are we doing wrong now?\\n\\nWith theme provider is not a function.\\n\\nWe need these decorators like so.\\n\\nIt's not part of the parameter object ahead.\\n\\nSo we're not going to do the themes.\\n\\nWe are going to do the provider, which is our theme up there.\\n\\nAnd we get to our base style.\\n\\nStill having problems with us.\\n\\nSearch for this theme provider.\\n\\nOkay, so we're going to be using it with Radix UI.\\n\\nWe can find an example.\\n\\nSo that one says it's missing.\\n\\nIt's talking about start compliance.\\n\\nIt doesn't just work.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nProvider theme.\\n\\nAdd-on styling.\\n\\nGlobal styles is the base.\\n\\nWe're just dropping the theme there.\\n\\nLet's see if that actually helps.\\n\\nOkay, so it's not liking this one, but.\\n\\nLet's see if it's affected.\\n\\nOh wow.\\n\\nOkay, so it's really broken stuff.\\n\\nSometimes it pays just to comment stuff out to get it going.\\n\\nMake sure that it is working properly.\\n\\nOkay, this is looking a bit better.\\n\\nOkay, so we still got a problem there.\\n\\nLet's have a quick look at what that actually is looking like.\\n\\nSo it has got some classes on it, but none of them are being pulled in from the Radix UI.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nLet's try and add that in.\\n\\nOkay, so as soon as we do that, it's not working without the theme provider.\\n\\nOkay, still not working.\\n\\nWe added the theme provider in and still not working.\\n\\nStorybook add-on styling is not a function.\\n\\nLet's look for that.\\n\\nOkay, so we're going to add a new feature.\\n\\nWe're going to add a new feature.\\n\\nWe're going to add a new feature.\\n\\nWe're going to add a new feature.\\n\\nOkay, so we're going to add a new feature.\\n\\nWe're going to add a new feature.\\n\\nWe're going to add a new feature.\\n\\nWe're going to add a new feature.\\n\\nOkay, let's see if this example.\\n\\nOkay, we can't see that.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nThe older styling here.\\n\\nThere's no storybook.\\n\\njs.\\n\\nIt's old.\\n\\nLet's go and look at our issues here.\\n\\nHmm.\\n\\nWith theme by class name from storybook add-on themes, but I believe this issue might be with all theme functions.\\n\\nI'm using with themes by class name.\\n\\nThat's something similar.\\n\\nIt's quite common when you're searching for sort of open source projects.\\n\\nSometimes it's easier just to go to the issue.\\n\\nLooks like this is another issue that someone else has about three days ago.\\n\\nLet's see if ours is any different to then.\\n\\nThis is from add-on themes.\\n\\nLet's just make sure that we've got it correctly.\\n\\nMaybe it's looking like it's different.\\n\\nOh, this looks better.\\n\\nModule not found.\\n\\nOkay, so not that one place possibly.\\n\\nWe have to go into the documentation here.\\n\\nAgain, this is with style components, which are not really.\\n\\nYeah, this one's got with add-on styling.\\n\\nSo this is what we had previously.\\n\\nOkay, sort of a style and deprecated in favor of the functionality that you're looking for.\\n\\nHowever, was neither intended for a native storybook.\\n\\nOkay, so still meant to be that.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nLet's go find the documentation.\\n\\nOkay, search.\\n\\nOkay, global theming.\\n\\nThat's not what I want.\\n\\nThat's a dark and light theme.\\n\\nWhat about.\\n\\nThat's completely not what I want.\\n\\nOkay, let's get on here.\\n\\nTesting snapshot, testing interaction, testing, T-Sarana sharing design integrations.\\n\\nOkay, so we're looking at.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nOkay, so we're going to go ahead.\\n\\nWe can have a preview body.\\n\\nMaybe this is what we actually need.\\n\\nLet's try that.\\n\\nI'm going to review all these previews.\\n\\nSo I've got a couple of.\\n\\nChanges that I've made.\\n\\nWe'll leave those there for now and we'll add on.\\n\\nOnce we get the theme working with the preview body.\\n\\nThat way, when we do this, we can do a.\\n\\nLet's just put a div.\\n\\nThe class name.\\n\\nI work.\\n\\nWorked just like that.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nStop that.\\n\\nPreviews being reverted.\\n\\nNow there.\\n\\nAll right, that's that and code.\\n\\nSo you guys can see.\\n\\nSo I've added this preview body.\\n\\nAnd a class name.\\n\\nBack to Chrome.\\n\\nThat's cool.\\n\\nThat doesn't seem to be showing.\\n\\nIt's not in the HTML.\\n\\nLet's find out more about this preview body.\\n\\nThe story rendering.\\n\\nThe storybook will inject these tags into the preview iframe where your components rendered not the storybook application you are.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\n[ Pause ] Storybook preview body.\\n\\nLet's copy the example.\\n\\nI wonder if we can find an example project as well.\\n\\n[ Pause ] Hi!\\n\\nThis is a video that I will be taking a look at.\\n\\nSo, I'm going to go ahead and look at the storybooks that are available to have a look at.\\n\\nFortunately, no red X.\\n\\nRight, and see if that comes up.\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo, I'm going to go ahead and do a little bit of a look at the storybook.\\n\\nSo, I'm going to go ahead and look at the storybook.\\n\\nTake a look, hold on.\\n\\nAnd I'm going to go ahead and do a little bit of a look at the storybook.\\n\\nNow, I'm not sure if Chakra's got a theme provider.\\n\\nIt's kind of cool though.\\n\\nWe can have our storybook theme too.\\n\\nAlright, let's go back to another project.\\n\\nSometimes the best way to understand how something should work is literally to take a look at what is currently being done with other projects.\\n\\nOkay, let's go ahead and look at the storybook.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nThat's a little rapid.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nThis looks pretty complex.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nThis is looking like it could be a winner.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nWe didn't actually check to see if the customer route was actually taking effect.\\n\\nLet's see, it still doesn't look like it's working.\\n\\nWe've got a default view there.\\n\\nLook at the storybook class.\\n\\nWe've got a storybook route.\\n\\nThat is our button.\\n\\nOkay, so it is updating.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nLet's try this as well.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nIs there a body?\\n\\nReview.\\n\\nWhat is that?\\n\\nReviewBody.js.\\n\\nReview.\\n\\nAnd it's just kind of pull off.\\n\\nIt's like.\\n\\nWe've got the radio there, we've got the matches, we've got the controls.\\n\\nLet me try something like Add a preview here.\\n\\nAnd let's just go something pretty crazy out there.\\n\\nCompletely.\\n\\nLet me stop that.\\n\\nSomething like that more.\\n\\nIs where I'm going wrong.\\n\\nIt should be.\\n\\nThat's frustrating.\\n\\nWhen you read the docs, read the docs.\\n\\nBack to Chrome here.\\n\\nWe've got HTML.\\n\\nStill no joy.\\n\\nI'm just going to start and stop it.\\n\\nRefresh.\\n\\nHey, we've got a customer out.\\n\\nWe haven't got our stuff appearing there inside it.\\n\\nWe've got some way that we can wrap it around.\\n\\nIt's not going to be much fun though because it's.\\n\\nIt's just going to embed it as HTML.\\n\\nBack to.\\n\\nOkay, so it's got JavaScript, TypeScript.\\n\\nSo they're all done.\\n\\nThe rendering is there.\\n\\nWe've got our style.\\n\\nWe also need a way to get that layout working.\\n\\nThat's just the layout in terms of how we can see it.\\n\\nWe want to be able to wrap just like we've got our.\\n\\nSort of code here in the.\\n\\nDown here in the page.\\n\\nAnd the page has.\\n\\nPage that's inside layout.\\n\\nAnd layout has the.\\n\\nRoot layout and it also has the theme component.\\n\\nOkay, so that theme component is what is provided from Radix UI.\\n\\nAnd that's going to give all our coloring based on that.\\n\\nWe can add an option to this theme provider and of course change our colors across the board.\\n\\nWe need to get that into our storybook so that we can actually get that same theme in coming across.\\n\\nAlways it's going to be a bit useless.\\n\\nSo let's try and.\\n\\nGo back to my Chrome here.\\n\\nAnd in it I've got.\\n\\nSo story layout is how it's actually positioned on the page.\\n\\nWhich we will use.\\n\\nI think we should put the buttons on the center there.\\n\\nThat would be great.\\n\\nIt would make sense to do that.\\n\\nI'm actually going to do it just now.\\n\\nLet's do it anyway.\\n\\nIt's going to be better.\\n\\nSo in our preview.js we'll copy that.\\n\\nBack up here.\\n\\nIn our preview.js.\\n\\nIn our preview parameters.\\n\\nAnd we've got layout.\\n\\nOne we want to update.\\n\\nOkay, I think I'm centered.\\n\\nLike that.\\n\\nOkay, so we go back to our storybook.\\n\\nI'm not having much joy with this.\\n\\nI check my spelling because that could be what's wrong.\\n\\nOkay, I might have to stop and start storybook potentially.\\n\\nOkay, so storybooks.\\n\\nStarting there.\\n\\nWow, nothing's working today.\\n\\nMight be time to just pack it in and start again next time.\\n\\nOh, this is going terribly.\\n\\nNothing is seeming to work.\\n\\nLet's go look at a basic version of that preview.js.\\n\\nOkay, so we're going to do a quick preview.\\n\\nWe're going to do a quick preview.\\n\\nMaybe preview body I wonder if this is because it's requiring it to sit over there and preview head.\\n\\nLet's go back to our component here I'm going to go to our customer.\\n\\nI added that 1, 2, 3 to it.\\n\\nLet's stop it and start it again that's stored what that is okay so it's getting that let's go back to the storybook itself.\\n\\nDoes it actually render that?\\n\\nIt does okay so you could add some HTML around it but that's actually not really going to help us.\\n\\nWe want to be able to add the JavaScript theme component just like we do for the standard page and I'd like to do it at the top level rather than have to do it further down the chain in each storybook but it's looking like that's not going to be an easy thing to do.\\n\\nSo what can we do instead?\\n\\nNow we can't have with this default here any parameters around it but let's have a look.\\n\\nSo this is the default in the story that's just the arguments. Ah!\\n\\nArgs can modify any aspect of your component.\\n\\nYou can use Args in your stories to configure the component's appearance similar to what you do in an application.\\n\\nFor example here's how you could use a photo argument to populate a child component.\\n\\nThis is going to import the page, have it as a child.\\n\\nOkay this could actually be what we want.\\n\\nThe only downside is this is at that story level.\\n\\nSo we do have that render function.\\n\\nSome components require a harnessed render and a use away.\\n\\nFor instance if a component runs right up to its edges you might want to space it inside Storybook.\\n\\nUse a decorator to add spacing for all stories of the component.\\n\\nOkay so with that example.\\n\\nApply story.\\n\\nStory to enable it.\\n\\nI'll take some locking.\\n\\nOkay so this is on preview.js.\\n\\nBack to where we started.\\n\\nTheme provided there, theme default.\\n\\nThis is actually looking more like what we want.\\n\\nLet's try this again.\\n\\nBeing a developer is probably 90% reading the documents.\\n\\nEspecially if you're using open source projects.\\n\\nJust to be able to implement it in your own project.\\n\\nOkay so this is my preview.\\n\\nI'm just going to wipe this out.\\n\\nAh they don't have style components.\\n\\nBut what I do have is down in my layout.\\n\\nI have Radix themes.\\n\\nOkay so I want to wrap my theme.\\n\\nLike so.\\n\\nLet's see.\\n\\nLet's see if it's getting that.\\n\\nInteresting enough it's getting some styling.\\n\\nIt does look to be getting red xui themes.\\n\\nOkay I think we get in there.\\n\\nGo back to code.\\n\\nOkay so we've got the preview.\\n\\nNormally you'd load in the CSS.\\n\\nWe could just try that initially just like we've got in the layout here.\\n\\nWe're just sort of having a global sort of import here of our styles.\\n\\nOkay let's save that.\\n\\nBack to Chrome.\\n\\nOkay so it's still not loading our style sheet.\\n\\nWe're getting on the red xui themes.\\n\\nWe're just not getting, you can see here we've got no styling coming into play here.\\n\\nWhereas if we go back to our actual rendering of our LMS app.\\n\\nWe go on the button.\\n\\nOpen up the inspect tools.\\n\\nNow we should have a whole lot of styles on the, when it loads.\\n\\nI'm not sure why it's taking so long.\\n\\nI have to stop the dev environment.\\n\\nThat should, click it off again.\\n\\nThere we go.\\n\\nCool so we can see that there with that button.\\n\\nWe've got all the layout CSS coming in.\\n\\nWhich is what we want to actually have happen.\\n\\nThat looks different to the docs.\\n\\nOkay there's some weird there it's pulling in some css.\\n\\nWe don't want that, those are our parameters which we will do later.\\n\\nWe tried to do this before with your component files and put ccs, this will work too.\\n\\nNotice all the exceptions for using a css processor like sass/scss or post css.\\n\\nLet's try that again, it should be pulling in styles.\\n\\nWe're in preview, we have the theme, the story, the style sheet, and no issues.\\n\\nLet's see if we're getting that style sheet coming.\\n\\nIt's not looking good, let's have a look under ccs.\\n\\nWe're not getting a style sheet, though it looks like we are.\\n\\nWe might have to look into what red x is doing.\\n\\nIt looks like we have a style sheet coming in there.\\n\\nI'm just going to comment out the css that is being passed in.\\n\\nWe should probably be able to refresh that now and take a look at that component.\\n\\nWe're still getting the style sheet so there must be four coming from what's called a storybook.\\n\\nIf it's coming from storybook, why are we not getting our style sheet?\\n\\nMaybe it's because of the iframe that it's using.\\n\\nWe can have a link in our main to the javascript, like an example of the oven analytics.\\n\\nLet's keep looking, we can add a preview html.\\n\\nLet's switch back to code here.\\n\\nIt's not working, it's not as simple as that is it?\\n\\nStop and start storybook.\\n\\nLet's see if we can open this up a bit wider to see our components.\\n\\nWe can always try and see if we can access it from the red x folder.\\n\\nThis is that style sheet here.\\n\\nWe're in storybook.\\n\\nModule not found, what's interesting is that as soon as I do that, it's found.\\n\\nThat's something to do with the actual style sheet itself and that shouldn't matter.\\n\\nIt doesn't like that because it's in javascript.\\n\\nMaybe if I do it in the preview head.\\n\\nPreview compiled one error, what is that one here?\\n\\nLet's get back to chrome.\\n\\nThis might be all the storybook stuff that hasn't loaded.\\n\\nI'm going to stop and start storybook.\\n\\nNo matter what, we're not getting that style sheet in there.\\n\\nDon't think preview head is javascript, let's get back to the docs preview.\\n\\nThat's our layout.\\n\\nWe've got a component.\\n\\nAdding to the heat.\\n\\nHTML, that's probably why.\\n\\nNice start-ups morning.\\n\\nLet's go back in our browser.\\n\\nGone.\\n\\nIt's gone.\\n\\nOkay, so we're gonna start with root.\\n\\nWe've got all the styling going on.\\n\\nWe have our, yes, we've got our Radix theme styling.\\n\\nThat's a good phone.\\n\\nBut we got now a button that's gone somewhere else completely.\\n\\nNow it's weird that it's there.\\n\\nWe need to give it some space or something.\\n\\nProperty failure.\\n\\nIt's coming from iFrame.\\n\\nIt's there, but we can't see it.\\n\\nIs it CSS?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nThere's a reset going on, which is cool.\\n\\nWe might have that issue with storybook versus our styling.\\n\\nIt's there and we know it's got all the button.\\n\\nCrazy.\\n\\nLet's say look, is it visible none?\\n\\nJust transparent?\\n\\nCould actually just change the background color here.\\n\\nOkay, but is transparent.\\n\\nIt is trying to load it there.\\n\\nIt is doing that.\\n\\nMust be something else that's added when it's imported.\\n\\nHmm.\\n\\nIt's a lot of read and now it's CSS anyway.\\n\\nStill complaining there.\\n\\nData is the right thing.\\n\\nWhat's interesting is that these variables are on the right level.\\n\\nA lot of issues here though.\\n\\nCan't do that.\\n\\nWe always do have one option.\\n\\nLet's try making our own component that's going to wrap.\\n\\nWe have the verpa there.\\n\\nLike this.\\n\\nSo this way we could make a wrapper that we know is going to render.\\n\\nThat we know is going to have the style sheet loaded.\\n\\nOkay, and we're just going to have to go into our story.\\n\\nLook back at the storybook.\\n\\nWe've got the main up here.\\n\\nWe've got the preview.\\n\\nLet's put wrapper here.\\n\\nNow import.\\n\\nOpponents.\\n\\nRapper.\\n\\nOkay, so that's loading there.\\n\\nWe've got our wrapper component.\\n\\nWe want to move our story up to here.\\n\\nAnd then we can hopefully do set out.\\n\\nThat's not a bad result, which is fine.\\n\\nWe'll have to go back a level.\\n\\nWhat is it done?\\n\\nThat's weird.\\n\\nSave that.\\n\\nI'm not playing.\\n\\nSo we might have to actually stop and start this.\\n\\nWell, that's no good.\\n\\nYes, that's working.\\n\\nOkay, that's working.\\n\\nNow we're getting out.\\n\\nThis is painful.\\n\\nPreview here.\\n\\nIt's probably coming from that.\\n\\nLet's remove that.\\n\\nI'm not sure if it gets refreshed.\\n\\nYeah, I have to stop and start storybook.\\n\\nShow cool.\\n\\nRemove that.\\n\\nOur wrapper is doing that.\\n\\nThe jazz style.\\n\\nLet's just do it directly on the div.\\n\\nWell, we are JSX land.\\n\\nIt's really brutal.\\n\\nAnd I actually even have a style tag, a bit of into JSX.\\n\\nI don't know if I can, but let's give it a try.\\n\\nNot going to like that.\\n\\nSo we're battling with J6.\\n\\nWhat about.\\n\\nthe end.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nAh, so I'm just going to take the colors, but I don't just want the colors.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nOh, my storybook.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nOkay so this did nothing in the end.\\n\\nWe can probably get rid of that.\\n\\nLet's go back to our story.\\n\\nI mean this does make it easier.\\n\\nUm without the router there.\\n\\nLet's try removing that.\\n\\nWe did need the theme.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nyou OK, let's tidy this up now.\\n\\nWe've got the button showing.\\n\\nLet's grab the same link.\\n\\nLet's see it back in our VS Code so we can actually see it.\\n\\nOK, that's looking better.\\n\\nRemove that.\\n\\nWe now have a head.\\n\\nLike so.\\n\\nAnd we've got a preview body.\\n\\nSo we can ditch the preview body.\\n\\nGet rid of that.\\n\\nWe can get rid of the wrapper.\\n\\nBecause we're not using that anymore.\\n\\nOK, so now we should be able to go.\\n\\nLook at that.\\n\\nLook at that.\\n\\nGot preview modules.\\n\\nOK, let's stop and start Storybook because we just want to check it one more time.\\n\\nIt's not looking quite the same.\\n\\nI think there's still some issue there for Starsheet.\\n\\nIt's not looking quite the same.\\n\\nI think there's still some issue there for Starsheet.\\n\\nWhat are these?\\n\\nAh, Storybook static.\\n\\nLooks like I've got something to fix up.\\n\\nI'm going to add this to my GetIgnore.\\n\\nIt's a common thing with the likes of any project.\\n\\nOK, so now that's much better.\\n\\nAh, Storybook static's there.\\n\\nThe build was kicked off and that's hence why it did that.\\n\\nI should probably do that every once in a while.\\n\\nIf you wanted to actually run that as a build process, maybe some artifacts or something like that, you want to part of your GitHub actions or something like that.\\n\\nAh, it's part of your CI.\\n\\nYou could do so.\\n\\nOK, let's go back to here and let's make all these changes.\\n\\nPlay button component.\\n\\nStyling.\\n\\nAll right, I'm going to sync those changes.\\n\\nAnd I think I'm going to call it quits now.\\n\\nWe're at two hours and ten.\\n\\nHopefully that was helpful.\\n\\nI know sometimes the battle is sometimes the thing that you want to watch.\\n\\nThings don't always go right.\\n\\nWhat you can expect will work doesn't.\\n\\nSo yeah, being able to do this kind of thing and just be determined.\\n\\nShow your grit.\\n\\nWork through your problems, try and get back to basics.\\n\\nTry and prove that something is or not working.\\n\\nThat's how you can debug stuff.\\n\\nAnd it's not always the help you get is perfect.\\n\\nSometimes you have to actually think about what is actually happening or what isn't happening and go through those sort of steps to actually try and figure out what is going wrong.\\n\\nNow, it isn't something that you learn in like two seconds, but it is something that you learn over a career.\\n\\nSo what do you do if you have those issues?\\n\\nSometimes you just keep at it.\\n\\nSometimes you actually walk away from the keyboard because it's easier.\\n\\nI come back to it and I'm sure you'll solve the problem in your head.\\n\\nBut otherwise, hopefully that was good.\\n\\nHave a great weekend.\\n\\nIf you are watching this on the weekend, of course, this was livestream.\\n\\nHave a look at the other videos in the series so you can see the last one or storybook where I set that up.\\n\\nI'm going to continue.\\n\\nTry and be a more regular cadence so that people can watch these sort of weekly or fortnightly.\\n\\nAnd don't forget to please like and subscribe.\\n\\nThat helps me get to more people out there.\\n\\nAnd hopefully you enjoyed it.\\n\\nCatch you all later.\\n\\n_Please note this transcript was edited for

In this live stream, Andrew Ford set up Next.js, configured it for the project, installed Radix UI, created a Superbase database, and started adding routes. The project code is available on GitHub as LMS NextJS.\\nogimage: \\\"full-stack2.jpg\\\"\\n---\\n\\n{% figure \\\"./full-stack2.jpg\\\", \\\"&quot;A web full-stack app built with NextJS&quot; / Bing Image Creator\\\" %}\\n\\nThe following is a transcript of my live stream on YouTube Sep 18, 2023 on Building a Full-Stack web app with Next.js. This is the second video in the series where I set up Next.js and configure it for these streams. This transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\\n\\nThe project is available on GitHub as LMS NextJS.\\n\\nyoutube.com/embed/2BQcCGCsql0?si=-ucJrgg1Wn3ZpHvc\\n\\n---\\n\\nHow's the stream now?\\n\\n[ Pause ] All right, cool.\\n\\nOkay, it looks like we're all live.\\n\\nHello everyone.\\n\\nSo again, this is the second part in the Builder Fill Stack Next.\\n\\njs app.\\n\\nLast week on Thursday, we did a planning session.\\n\\nAnd so I went through how I was going to plan the app, go through things like a wire framing.\\n\\nSo we have a link for that here.\\n\\nAnd we've also got the mind map, which was here.\\n\\nOkay, so we've got the brainstorm here.\\n\\nIt was what we went over on Thursday.\\n\\nAnd we also have the actual, not the code yet.\\n\\nThat's what we haven't got.\\n\\nSo I've got all this information, what we did on Thursday, that is now available on my website, so on andrewford.co.nz, it's the first article on the list at the moment.\\n\\nIt's built with fullstack and NextJS, part one planning.\\n\\nSo if you look at that, there is the link to the video, link to the wireframes, screenshot of the whiteboarding and there's a whole transcript there of the entire video.\\n\\nSo if you want to quickly find something you can do so.\\n\\nAwesome!\\n\\nOkay, all right what are we going to do today?\\n\\nToday we are going to start setting up the initial parts of the app.\\n\\nOkay so I'm going to go through that whole process of installing the actual code on a local machine, setting it up in a GitHub repo, pushing that to public so that you guys can see it.\\n\\nAnd then I'm also going to try and start the part of actually building the app, start looking at the wireframe there and start getting that working.\\n\\nOkay cool okay so if we go to the docs for Next.js\\n\\nso on the Next.js org website forward slash docs there is a usually what's for pretty much every single website you can imagine these are getting started page and getting started page is generally what we want to look at in in terms of actually installing all the prerequisites there and actually get it up and running.\\n\\nSo first of all, number one, you're going to need Node.js 16.\\n\\n14 or later and pretty wide range here.\\n\\nYou've got macOS, Windows or Linux.\\n\\nOkay, I'm going to open up a terminal window.\\n\\nLet me see.\\n\\nOK.\\n\\nSo in my developer directory I'm going to go into YouTube.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nOK, so I'm going to create a new project here.\\n\\nAgain, we need to look at that MPX command.\\n\\nSo let's grab that.\\n\\nCome back to terminal here and this is going to install the latest version of create next.\\n\\nSo what is your project named?\\n\\nWe're going to call it LMS next.js.\\n\\nOK, we're not going to use TypeScript.\\n\\nI'll do that another time.\\n\\nWe are going to use lint, use lint, node of tailwind, estimate source directory, yesterday app router, node to the import alias.\\n\\nSo this is going to set up the over code needed there for React, React-DOM, Next, DSLint, and Excellent Config Next.\\n\\nFunnily enough it says those things in the Installing Dependencies part there.\\n\\nSo, okay, cool.\\n\\nLet's have a look at this directory now.\\n\\nIf we go into the LMS folder, okay, cool.\\n\\nThink about it, it's already set up a Git repo folder there.\\n\\nI'm going to open up this folder now.\\n\\nSo open full stop or period depending on where you live.\\n\\nSo open there is going to open up the finder.\\n\\nCool so we can see the actual files themselves.\\n\\nCool and we can do code.\\n\\nfullstop and that is going to open up a nice vision of VS Code already pointing at that directory.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nOkay so I've got that up and running.\\n\\nYou should be able to see that on the screen.\\n\\nWhat I'm going to do next is start talking about what other dependencies we needed.\\n\\nSo going back to the whiteboard here.\\n\\nSo I talked about the need to have Radix UI.\\n\\nSo I was going to use that for my UI components.\\n\\nway I'm not building them from scratch sort of thing.\\n\\nInstead I can actually just worry about the other parts of the app rather than the actual UI components because I know that these components have been tested, they've got really good accessibility.\\n\\nInstead I can just focus on I guess the back end parts of the app and not have to worry too much about the front end.\\n\\nThe other part that I'm going to need is of course Superbase and so we'll set that up as well.\\n\\nOkay so let's go to the Radix UI website.\\n\\nOkay again it's a nice big getting started button let's use that.\\n\\nAgain, I'm going to copy that and I am going to open up the terminal window here.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo while that's installing, let's go back and have a look at the getting started guide here.\\n\\nAfter that, I need to import the global CSS file at the root of your application.\\n\\nThen I need to add the theme component and add theme to your application, wrapping the root component inside of body.\\n\\nOK, cool, grab that.\\n\\nOK, so that's installed.\\n\\nAnd it'll go into the source directory.\\n\\nAnd in here, we actually have the actual layer of the app.\\n\\nOkay, let's have a quick look at this, get our head around what's actually happening.\\n\\nSo first up we have a page.\\n\\nIt's a home component and we also have an image being pulled into it.\\n\\nSo this is the actual content of that page and the layout would be the core part of the app is being built.\\n\\nYou can see there that we have the HTML tags and of course the body there.\\n\\nSo what I'm going to do is I'm going to import the style sheet.\\n\\nAnd then after that I am going to then go back to the docs help file and I'm going to do the import process here.\\n\\nSo I'm going to import the theme.\\n\\nOkay, and then I'm going to wrap my app just like it has shown here in a theme component.\\n\\nAnd I can move it like so.\\n\\nOkay, cool.\\n\\nBody theme.\\n\\nOkay, I might actually do the same as what they have done.\\n\\nProbably pays to pay attention to what the instructions are doing.\\n\\nOkay and I've got an extra tag there.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nAll right.\\n\\nOkay so we have the theme going now.\\n\\nIf we actually run the application, let's see what happens.\\n\\nThat's localhost 3000.\\n\\nOkay, so we're not seeing any sort of UI changes or anything like that.\\n\\nWe've probably still got the initial stylings there from Next.js.\\n\\nLet's go with the Alumnares.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nCool, so the title's changed so we know that something's happening and that's tab and we can start pulling apart I guess what's already in there.\\n\\nI'm just going to rip it all out to this global style sheet and probably not going to use that.\\n\\nAgain it's starting to look very sparse and And if I do the same here, I'm going to have to be mindful of the fact that there's expecting those styles that are coming from that CSS module.\\n\\nSo I'm just going to pull that all out.\\n\\nWhy not?\\n\\nLet's make it home.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nstripped out, all completely pulled apart but we know that let's just double check that our CSS files that are coming in.\\n\\nWe can see here we've got a whole lot of CSS variables.\\n\\nSo these are the ones that are coming in from the likes of RadixUI.\\n\\nWe've got whole different color suites here, all available to us.\\n\\nAwesome.\\n\\nAll right, can we see that they have like a.\\n\\nIt's just telling us where the CSS is coming from.\\n\\nGot some default values here.\\n\\nAll right, and then we've got radix themes.\\n\\nOkay, we are on the way to getting there.\\n\\nOkay, all right.\\n\\nNext steps, you're now ready to use Radix themes components.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nI will probably stop there and a good place to stop probably is now into a commit of my source code.\\n\\nand it should commit added vertex UI.\\n\\nSo if you've got the GitHub extension here, you can actually also do the same as this and publish it live.\\n\\nAwesome, so if I open this now, I should be able to see that in Chrome.\\n\\nThere we go and it's public so you guys should be able to see that as well.\\n\\nAwesome.\\n\\nOkay next steps.\\n\\nLike I said we talked about we needed Next.\\n\\njs setup, we needed Radix UI setup.\\n\\nThe next probably part what we need is start talking thinking about our database.\\n\\nOkay it's pretty early on I know but it's good to get this up and running so we can actually start sort of planning out more of our app.\\n\\nOkay so let's find the Superbase website.\\n\\nCool, so I've already previously signed on with GitHub before, and I need to now create a new project.\\n\\nOK, I'll call it LMS.\\n\\nand copy that password and place that somewhere where I'm not gonna lose it okay All right, OK, my password is saved now.\\n\\nRegion.\\n\\nNot the closest to me.\\n\\nI might do Oceania Sydney there because that is closest to me.\\n\\nOK, I'm going to create that new project.\\n\\nAll right.\\n\\nOK, so I've got public key there.\\n\\nOkay, so it's safe to use in a browser.\\n\\nI'm not going to show you the secret one there.\\n\\nAnd we've got the URL there for the restful endpoint for creating and managing your database.\\n\\nAwesome.\\n\\nSame as usual.\\n\\nThis thing to do, open the docs again.\\n\\nAnd we'll click on the getting started here.\\n\\nNow it's got a quite big overview of some use cases and how you could use it.\\n\\nWe're actually going to be using it with Next.\\n\\njs and they do actually have a Next.\\n\\njs section which is a framework quick start.\\n\\nVery handy.\\n\\nSo we've created that new project.\\n\\nAfter it's done we should be able to see a table.\\n\\nOkay now we're not going to make a country's table.\\n\\nWe're going to go and start off maybe with our.\\n\\nprobably course, I think it might be a good one to start with.\\n\\nAnd then we will then have to add this super base off there.\\n\\nOkay so we can use either like this command line here where we can add the template and have a look at that to grab each piece we need.\\n\\nOr we can just actually manually add it into our project.\\n\\nSo if we take a look at this, I can actually copy this, I'm going to create this on the terminal.\\n\\nThis doesn't seem to be a link directly to the actual project there, unfortunately.\\n\\nNot a problem.\\n\\nWe'll sort that out, that's it.\\n\\nOkay and hopefully, yes our database is all set up and running now.\\n\\nOkay so we've got the database there so if we click on the table editor, you can see we've got learning new tables and we need to actually go and set it up with the likes of Superbase.\\n\\nNow does this actually have a nice walkthrough for.\\n\\nJust adding it to an existing project, that's what I want to do.\\n\\nOkay so here's an example here, so we need to install the Superbase.\\n\\njs file here.\\n\\nI'm going to double check this so that it matches what's the expected VF for next.\\n\\njs.\\n\\nI'm going to copy that and I'm going to jump back to the terminal.\\n\\nCreate a new tab.\\n\\nMove back a level.\\n\\nAgain, this is pretty much what we've already done previously.\\n\\nProbably in hindsight would have been better to have done this using this template, but that's not a problem.\\n\\nI'll show you how you can actually still understand what is actually happening.\\n\\nLet's make that text a little bit bigger.\\n\\nI'll put hard sound stream there.\\n\\nOkay, cool.\\n\\nSo that's completed.\\n\\nNow in that directory, I'm going to open a never version of code.\\n\\nwe're going to have to take a look at it.\\n\\nThe key part here is we can see that what's has been added to it.\\n\\nYou can see those dependencies.\\n\\nSo the great thing about any sort of node's JSP package, so whether it be using YARN or PNPM or NPM like we're using here, you can see what actual packages have been installed.\\n\\nSo dependencies of course are the the ones that we use in our actual app and dev dependencies are the ones we use when we are working on our project in a dev environment.\\n\\nOkay so I need both superbase of the auth and I'm going to need the superbase of the JS there.\\n\\nOkay so all of us is breaking, let's go and do that again.\\n\\nOkay so, control A, npm install.\\n\\nThere we go.\\n\\nOkay so that's a bit of update from our package.\\n\\nNice enough.\\n\\nWe've got the auth helpers there and we can do the npm install.\\n\\nLet's grab the other one.\\n\\nfrom here.\\n\\nAlright so now that's running, we've got the superbase js file there, we've got the auth helper for nextjs.\\n\\nWhat we've got is basically a roadmap of what we require.\\n\\nIf we take a look at the actual project for the one that was generated from the template there, nicely enough it's got an environment file.\\n\\nI'm going to copy that and place that into our project as well.\\n\\nBecause we're going to need something like this but we are going to drop the example part from there.\\n\\nNow big thing to look out for, it's a little bit harder to see, I don't know if the colour contrast is quite good but you can probably see that there's a whole lot of folders there on the left.\\n\\nWe've got the public, the source, the app etc.\\n\\nYou can see at the top we have a .\\n\\nnext folder and a node_modules folder.\\n\\nNow that no modules file was slightly off grey, off white sort of colour.\\n\\nThat means that it's being ignored.\\n\\nSo if we look at our git tab here, you can see that only the two pages there, it's showing.\\n\\nI'm going to refresh that.\\n\\nOK.\\n\\nAnd luckily enough, it looks like our environment local file is also on this list for git ignore.\\n\\nNow if it wasn't, you'd have to go into edit and to here, and you would have to hide that environment file.\\n\\nBut we don't have to.\\n\\nThankfully, we have the KIT-Ignore has already got that local nv file that's not been committed to our source code.\\n\\nAnd why do we not want to commit to our source code?\\n\\nWell, because we basically would be given the keys away to the house.\\n\\nIf we push that up there, especially this repo is public, you can be sure that there'll be a whole lot of people who are running scripts hitting GitHub and basically looking for projects that have API keys that are available to steal.\\n\\nSo don't let that happen to you.\\n\\nThere are some nice features now in GitHub which can actually look out for you and make sure that those keys don't go into your repo.\\n\\nBut yeah, there's just a Top tip there, making sure that you're not giving away the keys to the house.\\n\\nOkay cool, so that's working.\\n\\nWe've got that environment, local file.\\n\\nI'll update this later and we'll never look at it again.\\n\\nSo what I'll do is I'll grab my keys that I need for that and then I'll be able to see what's happening there.\\n\\nOkay, right.\\n\\n[pause] [laughs] Okay.\\n\\nSo we've got the Superbase parts pasted into our app.\\n\\nWe've got them sitting in the package there.\\n\\nSo we'll have those node modules now installed.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo what's next?\\n\\nLet's look at what has actually been done.\\n\\nOkay, so great thing it's already been set up for us.\\n\\nWe actually have some components there so we can take these and the same with that super base directory.\\n\\nWe can grab those and put them into our own app.\\n\\nThat way, I'm having the same sort of setup as what's already there.\\n\\nWe're going to have a little bit of issues, and the key thing there that will be a bit of a pain will be the fact that this is in TypeScript, and we're not using TypeScript, so we will have some renaming today.\\n\\nOkay, I'm going to go and set up the same folder structure basically.\\n\\nI've got source app and I'm going to have a source components.\\n\\nLike that.\\n\\nOkay, and we are going to need We already have an app folder, a super based folder.\\n\\nOkay, I actually don't want any of this to do some stuff, so this is actually not a bad thing anyway to not have this already pre-configured.\\n\\nI'm just gonna leave that out, not have any migrations there.\\n\\nWe'll do that later and what I do want to do, let's look at these components here.\\n\\nWe'll start off with the logout button.\\n\\nI'm not too worried about the other two.\\n\\nOkay so this one is a JavaScript file.\\n\\nAnd looking at this we can see, you know, it's relatively basic here, I can see it's using Tailwind but we're not using that.\\n\\nVery export, default, I call it Lockout button, good to have the same name there and we're going to return just keep it as simple as that if we want to.\\n\\nI probably might be using one of these buttons but that's okay we will grab that form and we'll put that button inside it.\\n\\nNow one thing that's going to be slightly different of course is that we are using the Radix UI so there'll be a button component already available for that, but I will change that shortly.\\n\\nOkay so I've got my logo button, what next do we need to add to our app?\\n\\nSo again they've got the layouts, they've got very simple page.\\n\\nOkay so they are setting up a server base and they're getting a user.\\n\\nOkay so basically doing a check there to see if they are logged in.\\n\\nOkay, not a problem.\\n\\nOkay, so that's all good.\\n\\nWe'll do that shortly.\\n\\nThey also have a logon, and so they've got a page here, so this is a logon page, and they also have the off components here.\\n\\nSo we've got sign up, sign out, sign in.\\n\\nSo there's these routes.\\n\\nOkay so these will act as the next response there.\\n\\nSo if we make a request to any of these URLs then we get the different redirects someplace.\\n\\nOkay cool, I should be able to just actually.\\n\\nOkay it's gonna do there, that's it.\\n\\nOkay so I'm gonna need that um 'Off' folder.\\n\\nThat's sitting under the app.\\n\\nOkay and we'll start setting up these folders.\\n\\n\\\"Sign Up\\\", \\\"sign out\\\", \\\"sign in\\\".\\n\\nAnd the iPhone 1 was callback.\\n\\nOkay, so that's all going to be part of our app.\\n\\nAs well as Okay, and the Alpha 1 was callback.\\n\\nI'm going to have focus.\\n\\nOkay, so that's all going to be part of our app as part of the authentication side of things.\\n\\nOkay let's start off with the sign up.\\n\\nWhat can we copy?\\n\\nMostly the same.\\n\\nOkay I'm just going to copy this and I know that's going to complain but it's fine.\\n\\nCopy that.\\n\\nNew file, make it our route file, then we can paste it in.\\n\\nSo the only thing we're having a issue here with here is this.\\n\\nWe don't have this request object.\\n\\nRequest type, sorry.\\n\\nOkay, but we can have it like that and pretty much shouldn't complain.\\n\\nYep, that's the only difference there by having it in TypeScript or not.\\n\\nOkay, so that's all cool.\\n\\nSame again.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo what are we doing?\\n\\nWhat are we actually doing here?\\n\\nWe're actually making all the different app calls here So great thing about Next.\\n\\njs is that it's both a front-end and back-end in WAM So we don't have to create a separate Express app or something of a like to act as our API And again Same as before.\\n\\nIt's generally good to at least get to a known point.\\n\\nSo slowly, I've just read it here.\\n\\nSo what we're trying to do is we're trying to get to a point where just like the super based data that people be able to just start the communication side of things.\\n\\nLike I said before, in the previous session we need this app to both be available, parts of it to be available on the public and parts of it available on private only.\\n\\nSo I logged in users.\\n\\nOkay so we'll then sign in, again grab this.\\n\\nRemove that request.\\n\\nOkay and the callback.\\n\\nOkay, call back, set.\\n\\nAgain, another route.\\n\\nOkay, anything else that I am going to need I've got my routes, I've got my page.\\n\\nSo they have a logon page which I don't have.\\n\\nSo it's got some messages here.\\n\\nAgain, pretty simple, could probably just copy that and rename it.\\n\\nAgain, just change the file extension and I can do the same with the logon except I I am going to strip that out for a sec.\\n\\nSo we'll copy that again, paste it, rename it.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nAlright, link on the logo there, don't worry about that, probably not.\\n\\nJust keep the back there.\\n\\nOf course I don't have any of these classes, I'm not using Tailwind.\\n\\nAnd we'll just leave the form in there for the time being, take out some of these classes.\\n\\nI'll sort these out with the red X1s in a sec.\\n\\nOkay, looking a lot better.\\n\\nOkay so that's not going to be so bloated I guess before Taiwan classes.\\n\\nOkay so that's the login and sign up and sign out.\\n\\nProbably a good point now to check in what we've added.\\n\\nSo I'm going to add the Superbase Event.\\n\\nThat's enough probably.\\n\\nOkay, I'll commit that, push it.\\n\\nOK.\\n\\nI'm not going too bad for time.\\n\\nOK, so we've got that there.\\n\\nWe've got the actual page there.\\n\\nWe've got what else we need.\\n\\nThey've got a middle here.\\n\\nSo we can do the same because we'll probably need to have some sort of middle here for authentication.\\n\\nSo I'm going to add that little sitting in, let's see, then sitting outside the app itself.\\n\\nAnd sitting in that top level.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nWe don't need a type.\\n\\nOkay, okay and what other parts have we not configured?\\n\\nLet's compare these.\\n\\nSo they've got the experimental zero actions on there.\\n\\nAdd those back in.\\n\\nMiddleware.\\n\\nThat's the Superbase folder.\\n\\nWe should be able to generate that from the CLI I believe.\\n\\nAnd we've got the LogoutButton.\\n\\nxjs logo, it's a base logo.\\n\\nNice.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nI've added those files back in.\\n\\nNow I'm going to actually make this project a dev container.\\n\\nSo we'll come at the changes here.\\n\\nLike so.\\n\\nOkay so let's push.\\n\\nOkay now I've got that set up.\\n\\nIf you watch my stream a couple of days ago I went over how we could set up a dev container.\\n\\nSo I'm going to add that now.\\n\\nI'm going to need Docker running.\\n\\nSo if I didn't have that running before I should have it shortly.\\n\\nOkay so that's running.\\n\\nNow I need to actually run this in a dev container.\\n\\nAdd that configuration file.\\n\\nAnd we'll just use the default for now.\\n\\nLet's just add it and we should be able to now reopen this in a container.\\n\\nSo the reason I'm adding it to Container is the version of Node.\\n\\nI've got it on.\\n\\nI'm trying to use 20.\\n\\nSlightly experimental, all the latest.\\n\\nSo the idea being that if I need to change, I can set my different version of node based on this dev container here.\\n\\nI can swap it out for something else.\\n\\nIt just means that in sort of future proofing.\\n\\nOkay, so that's running, and we'll run that to super.\\n\\nLocalhost 3000.\\n\\nOkay cool, it's running again.\\n\\nThat's what we wanted to see.\\n\\nOkay so that's running, you can see there it's made their requests.\\n\\nThat's all good.\\n\\nSo I've still got the app, I've got the page, so this is the home and its layout is sitting under here.\\n\\nJust wrapping that theme.\\n\\nOK so we can have a login component.\\n\\nSo if we try to go through that, let's give it a shot.\\n\\nWe should be able to go to login.\\n\\nOK so we've got a, not particularly pretty looking form, but that's there.\\n\\nOK, so we've got that working.\\n\\nAnd we've got our login.\\n\\nLet's keep going.\\n\\nOK.\\n\\nSo the key thing that we would need with anything that we're working on, of course, is our URL and the key there, so this has two keys.\\n\\nI'm just going to go back to the home, go into the project settings, and go to project, come to previous so we need the project URL.\\n\\nand paste that in in the non-public.\\n\\nOkay, so I'm probably to stop and start this for it's tick effect.\\n\\nSo I've got some friendly faces in the chat there.\\n\\nOkay, got those keys added, added them to that local config.\\n\\nThese are not my secret keys.\\n\\nThis is purely for safety use in browser if you have enabled early level security for your tables and configured policies.\\n\\nSo this is the one we would set up all our configuration there.\\n\\nSo that we would then have it secure.\\n\\nWe haven't set up any VC yet.\\n\\nIt's all early days.\\n\\nOf course I'll be changing these out at some point.\\n\\nOK, so we've got a table editor.\\n\\nWhat else do we need?\\n\\nWe're going to need to set that up and create a new table.\\n\\nLet's go back to our whiteboard session.\\n\\nWhat have we got here?\\n\\nSo I said we've got a student.\\n\\nWe've also got a course.\\n\\nCourse is probably the core table there.\\n\\nSo I'm going to create that table first.\\n\\nof course.\\n\\nIf I spelt it correctly.\\n\\nOkay, so I'm going to enable row level security.\\n\\nWe're not worried about it being real time.\\n\\nI need a column of a name.\\n\\nSo this is a some text here.\\n\\nAnd I'm also going to edit description.\\n\\nOkay, what have we done here?\\n\\nThis is the Superface Editor, so it's a great way to run a Postgres database in the cloud.\\n\\nAnd it allows me to just add a record there like so.\\n\\nI've got no active RSL policies at the present that will add those as needed.\\n\\nInsert a row to begin with.\\n\\nThat's automatic.\\n\\nThat we'll just use now.\\n\\nOK.\\n\\nFirst course is going to be on CSS.\\n\\nSo why not?\\n\\nCSS description.\\n\\nAnd now I've got my first table, awesome.\\n\\nOkay, so I've got our homepage.\\n\\nGot a table set up, we've got all the authentication done there.\\n\\nWe're on our way to actually building our app out.\\n\\nOkay, so what are we gonna do next?\\n\\nWe've got our attics installed, we've got super base now installed, we've got a table set up in the cloud, We've got a get repo now of our project.\\n\\nSo that's now publicly available.\\n\\nSo you guys can see that as well.\\n\\nAnd I'm just gonna add this div container now, and push that live.\\n\\n[silence] Okay, that's pushed to local file, it's sync up.\\n\\nAlright, so now we have this project.\\n\\nWe've got I guess the core parts of it that we initially needed set up.\\n\\nWe've got a dev container that can go with it.\\n\\nWe've got our Radix UI installed.\\n\\nWe've got the Superbase Auth helper here, the Superbase JS file, which is what we will used to retrieve the data from Superbase.\\n\\nWe've got ESLint, we've got ESLint config next, so it's a lint configuration for Next.js.\\n\\nWe've got Next itself, so next version 13.\\n\\nReact DOM, React, the other thing that I would like to add to this is prettier.\\n\\nSo I'm going to stop this and add that to the project.\\n\\nOkay I gently use prettier and ESLint together.\\n\\nOne for formatting and one for finding errors.\\n\\nOkay so let's install there.\\n\\nOkay that's done like that.\\n\\nThat's installed and do I have the extension?\\n\\nOkay so I'm going to install those in the dev container.\\n\\nSo I've got 'pretty' here, I can add 's-lint', I can sort of get it added.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nAwesome.\\n\\nOkay so those are both added there.\\n\\nAgain more changes, pretty as installed.\\n\\nAdd to my config, package config, package.\\n\\njson added prettier.\\n\\nAnd the other thing that I don't properly want to do, make sure I've got those extensions installed, now they're going to be part of this container, they're part of this user interface.\\n\\nSo we've got those there.\\n\\nThe other last thing I can do when we're starting up the project.\\n\\nIt's always nice to have a MPM install.\\n\\nSo this is going to start the project up when it first makes those dev containers and it is going to install all the node modules.\\n\\nSo I have that rebuild.\\n\\nJust saving the next person that has to probably open the project or ourselves.\\n\\nAnother thing to do basically of installing npm packages.\\n\\nOkay cool, I think I'm going to stop here today.\\n\\nSo we've got sort of like the basics there of the project.\\n\\nIt's all been configured, It's been set up.\\n\\nWe've grabbed a lot of parts from the existing template there for the likes of Next.js with Superbase And we've also set up our Superbase table Until next time we will do actually get the authentication running and We will try and get some data showing on the page coming from our database Hope you all enjoyed that Please like and subscribe if you haven't already That makes it easier to you know Not to keep doing more of these videos if I get the feedback there from you guys Please comment as well if you've got any questions And I'll try to answer those two All right.\\n\\nHave a great day and I will see you next time.\\n\\nCatch you later.\\n\\n_Please note this transcript was edited for

This is part 6 of the series. In this installment we create a Storybook for our project and start building out our Header component. I walk through some of the features of Storybook and how it can help you build your React components in isolation.\\n\\nThe project is available on GitHub as LMS NextJS.\\n\\nCheck out Storybook for more information.\\n\\nyoutube.com/embed/EGn-MsRIs4U?si=xT4O5dqmXvoaX0D0\\n\\n---\\n\\nCan you hear me alright?\\n\\nJust double checking the stream, always pays to.\\n\\nCool so we're good, we're good to go.\\n\\nSound is working.\\n\\nGetting a little bit of feedback here on my headset but that's OK, I can put up with that.\\n\\nOK so we've got this header here.\\n\\nWe built it last time, it's not much to it.\\n\\nAs you can see it's just literally a HTML header component with the H1 inside it there.\\n\\nWe didn't place it anywhere inside our app but we can keep going on that.\\n\\nLet's take a look at what we've actually done so far.\\n\\nSo we have gone through some planning last week.\\n\\nSo let's switch to Chrome, we'll just take a look at that.\\n\\nSo in Chrome we set up the planning for the Kanban board in GitHub projects.\\n\\nAnd you can see we have created a backlog of routes and components and items that we need to do.\\n\\nIn the in progress column we've got the header component there so that's underway.\\n\\nNow we can do a couple of things to help us in terms of building our React components.\\n\\nOne thing I like to do when working on a new project is to actually have a thing called Storybook.\\n\\nNow Storybook is a way for us to have a playground where we can build our components in isolation.\\n\\nWe can style them to our sort of heart's content away from the main app and it means that we can sort of configure them, set up easily the different properties for them, even have some dummy data set up so that we can maybe enable, disable, add new titles, content, you name it, that kind of thing.\\n\\nWe can do that.\\n\\nI have done a previous, I believe I did a previous video on that before so if you have a look back through my YouTube channel there's some guide sort of thing on how to do that but we'll start again from scratch.\\n\\nWe're going to add it to the project.\\n\\nWe'll get that going.\\n\\nWe will continue on building out our header component and we will continue on trying to start getting this project coming together.\\n\\nOkay, so what do we do when we want to start something?\\n\\nWe look at the docs.\\n\\nLet's look for Storybook here.\\n\\nStorybook.\\n\\njs.\\n\\norg.\\n\\nSo this is the one.\\n\\nOkay, so that's all new.\\n\\nLooks like they've updated it.\\n\\nThat's cool.\\n\\nOkay, so if we go to the Get Started guide, that's always a good place to start.\\n\\nThey've got a good channel on how to get it all set up and running but we'll do the same.\\n\\nSo they want us to initially install Storybook for the project and make sure that you read this part here.\\n\\nStorybook is not made for empty projects.\\n\\nStorybook needs to be installed.\\n\\nIf I work on empty projects, there are many ways to bootstrap in a framework.\\n\\nWe have an app already.\\n\\nSo I think we should be good.\\n\\nWe have the dependencies etc.\\n\\nSo let's get this underway then.\\n\\nSo I'm going to copy that mpx command and that's going to do the initialization on our project.\\n\\nSo let's go back to VS Code here.\\n\\nMake sure I'm in shot.\\n\\nOkay, so let's have a look.\\n\\nWe have VS Code.\\n\\nOkay, we've got the console line is running at the moment.\\n\\nI'm just going to stop that and on my workspace here, I've got my alamos next.\\n\\njs project.\\n\\nOkay, so I'm going to paste that in.\\n\\nmpx storybook latest initialize.\\n\\nOkay, cool.\\n\\nSo just double check.\\n\\nMake sure you've committed your code first.\\n\\nI can see here I'm good to go.\\n\\nJust to make sure.\\n\\nI'm going to do a good status.\\n\\nMake sure that I'm in the code first.\\n\\nI can see here I'm good to go.\\n\\nOkay, no problem.\\n\\nOkay, let's run that.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nWhile it's doing its thing, we should be able to start planning out what we're going to do with our component here.\\n\\nSo I've got that.\\n\\nLet's talk about this folder structure.\\n\\nI've created a separate components folder and it's got the header component in it and the logout button.\\n\\nOkay, we have detected that you're using ESLint storybook provides a plugin that gives the best experience for storybook and helps follow best practices.\\n\\nWould you like to install it?\\n\\nYes, I would.\\n\\nOkay, so it's going to add that ESLint plugin.\\n\\nKeep doing it.\\n\\nSo we've got the components folder.\\n\\nSo these components that are going to be used across the site.\\n\\nThey're not page components as such.\\n\\nSo it's all about working in a structure that you are going to understand.\\n\\nI like to keep mine relatively simple.\\n\\nBut of course, things change.\\n\\nYou can move stuff around as you build out your project.\\n\\nIt's not set in stone.\\n\\nThis is code.\\n\\nRemember, this is not granite that we are making our project out of.\\n\\nSo we can undo things.\\n\\nOkay, so it's taking a little bit of time there.\\n\\nNot a problem.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nOnce we have got that set up, we should have the Chrome, of course.\\n\\nWe should be able to get to the likes of the wizard.\\n\\nOkay, so before goes well, you just see a set up wizard that will help you start a story of introducing you to the main concepts and features, including how that UI is organized, how to write your first story, and how to test your components responses to various inputs utilizing controls.\\n\\nOkay, nice.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nWe're going to need to have this command here to start the story of workup.\\n\\nI'm going to copy that and let's go back and check on what code has done.\\n\\nAre we finished yet?\\n\\nNo, we've got one more question.\\n\\nYou need to install the following packages, npm 10.\\n\\nOkay, let's do that.\\n\\nOkay, so that's kind of open that.\\n\\nLet's grab this.\\n\\nSwitch back to Chrome.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nOkay, so let's go through a tour.\\n\\nThat's going to give us a bit of a guided tour of how it works.\\n\\nStart that.\\n\\nStorybook is built from stories.\\n\\nStorybook stories represent the key states of each of your components.\\n\\nWe automatically added four stories for this button component in this example file button dot stories dot JS.\\n\\nTo note that it's got these separate files here called stories.\\n\\nSo we can have our variations there.\\n\\nStory previews are interactive.\\n\\nSo when you modify code or story, storybook automatically updates how it previews your components.\\n\\nAnd this is the key core beauty of storybook here.\\n\\nYou are going to be able to see your components in isolation without any impact from the actual UI itself.\\n\\nMaybe other things could impact what your look and feel looks like.\\n\\nSo the way that you make your components with storybook is that you then hopefully make them all just independent of each other.\\n\\nAnd that's the whole goal of building components because we want to be able to reuse them.\\n\\nSo storybook previews are interactive.\\n\\nAnd you'll see here it's got this cool playground here where we have the controls and we can set values.\\n\\nWe can change this value here to false.\\n\\nHey, confetti.\\n\\nNice.\\n\\nSo with that, we can change that state from being primary to not being primary.\\n\\nSo it's just got a false there.\\n\\nSo that means that we can very quickly have just by properties alone, we can change a button to be of the primary type.\\n\\nSo what would that be?\\n\\nThat it could be maybe like on A form.\\n\\nMaybe you've got a save and a cancel.\\n\\nYou probably make the primary button the save because that's the interaction you're trying to ask the user to do.\\n\\nAnd then the cancel would be the non-primary look.\\n\\nSo less sort of eye-catching there.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo now it's got this little wizard here on how to write a story.\\n\\nSo these imports, first import meter and story object for type safety and autocompletion and typescript stories.\\n\\nWe're not using the likes of typescripts.\\n\\nSo we want to use it in this case.\\n\\nNext import a component, in this case, the button component.\\n\\nAnd then the default export, it contains metadata about this component stories.\\n\\nThe title field optional controls where stories appear in the sidebar.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo you got that button, you got a title.\\n\\nSo this is what you can name it for your example here.\\n\\nSo each named export is a story.\\n\\nSo its content specifies how the story is rendered in addition to other configuration options.\\n\\nSo you can have the, like in this case, the button component.\\n\\nThe button component has these variations, one being a primary.\\n\\nIt's in a secondary, large and small.\\n\\nI can see there on the left.\\n\\nSo we follow through this.\\n\\nWe can see all these arguments here.\\n\\nSo in this story file, we can set up each of these stories and each have its own object.\\n\\nAnd each object has its own arguments.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo these are all stuff that you set.\\n\\nThese are the properties for the components themselves.\\n\\nSo I would imagine this button component has got the properties of primary, label and background.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo those are properties for that component.\\n\\nSo if you cast your mind back to where your views react, maybe in the past.\\n\\nSo properties are things that you pass into your react components.\\n\\nWe'll go over that shortly.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo we'll continue with that.\\n\\nWe've got the arguments.\\n\\nCreate your first story.\\n\\nNow it's your turn.\\n\\nSee how easy it is to create the first story by following these steps below.\\n\\nCopy the warning story.\\n\\nOpen the button story in your current where you can do a tree and paste it at the bottom of the file and save.\\n\\nJust copy the code for now.\\n\\nAnd we'll close that.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nLet's have a look at back to our project now.\\n\\nWe should see a few different things here.\\n\\nLet's switch back to code.\\n\\nAll right.\\n\\nSo in our VS code, we can see the little green there.\\n\\nA little bit difficult to see.\\n\\nMaybe it needs to bump up in size.\\n\\nBut you can see here, there is now a folder called stories.\\n\\nSo we've got stories.\\n\\nIt's the same level as our components folder.\\n\\nAnd in that stories, we have a few files that it's created for us.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo we've got a button, funnily enough, a header, an ASM CSS, etc.\\n\\nAnd even a storage for that header.\\n\\nSo let's just take a look at it.\\n\\nIt's probably a little bit more complex than our one.\\n\\nThat's fine.\\n\\nAnd that's okay.\\n\\nWe can leave it like that.\\n\\nAnd in there, we can have our component.\\n\\nWe've got the CSS there.\\n\\nAnd I've got the, looks like some MDX there.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo it's made that folder for us.\\n\\nIt's set up the configuration.\\n\\nWe should see in our package.json.\\n\\nIf we look at our source control here, we should be able to see the difference between it.\\n\\nAnd we can see there.\\n\\nSo what has it done?\\n\\nWhat has it added to our project?\\n\\nIt's added the storybook there.\\n\\nSo it's got the port number running there, running the build, and then inside those dev dependencies, because these are for running locally, of course.\\n\\nSo it's when they're in the dev dependencies folder structure.\\n\\nSo we've got the storybook add-on essentials and add-on interactions, add-on links, add-on bombarding.\\n\\nSo all these are parts of the sort of the tutorial.\\n\\nAnd with React and testing library to go along with it with storybook itself.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nI'm 100% happy with that so far.\\n\\nIf we close it.\\n\\nNow the one thing I'm not kind of happy about is we've got our nice sort of component structure.\\n\\nAnd this comes down to personal preference.\\n\\nThis is not set in stone or anything.\\n\\nThe one downside, I guess, storybook is that by initially it will store all these files.\\n\\nWe can remove those.\\n\\nThat's not a big problem.\\n\\nSo let's actually go through and look at that.\\n\\nWhat are we going to need?\\n\\nWe have our header component.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nAnd we want to have a stories component for it.\\n\\nWe could actually just steal this, which is not a bad idea.\\n\\nIt's going to give us some ideas as well.\\n\\nAnd why not?\\n\\nSo we've got the header stories there.\\n\\nSo I'm not a big fan of just having the stories folder.\\n\\nI prefer just to put my stories into the components instead.\\n\\nThat way when I do so, then it's just going to sit in that folder with it.\\n\\nI like to keep them together.\\n\\nLet's do that.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nNo, I don't want that.\\n\\nI don't want to hear from stories.\\n\\nI want the header, which is this one.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo it's doing that.\\n\\nNow already we've got a difference here.\\n\\nIt's got an argument of a name.\\n\\nThis is a pretty good idea.\\n\\nWe'll leave it at that, I think.\\n\\nUse this not a bad idea to show on our header component.\\n\\nLet's actually go back to our storybook.\\n\\nNot a storybook, our sketches of what we actually did for design.\\n\\nBecause that would probably be helpful.\\n\\nLet's have a look at the ScalaDrawer.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nDid we have a username in there?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nThat's okay.\\n\\nWe don't need to have the same.\\n\\nSo we'll just take that out for now.\\n\\nSorry, I haven't switched screen.\\n\\nSo that's our ScalaDrawer.\\n\\nLooking at it now, our homepage.\\n\\nSimply got the logo and menu.\\n\\nVery basic.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo we'll step back to this.\\n\\nWhat was our design?\\n\\nLet's get back to code.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nAll right.\\n\\nSo I've got the users there.\\n\\nWe've got the arguments.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo we've got our Jane Doe.\\n\\nLet's take that out.\\n\\nJust for the time being.\\n\\nI'm sure we'll add some arguments in shortly.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo we've got an example header, layout full screen.\\n\\nWe've got the headers themselves.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo we've got the headers there.\\n\\nHeader there.\\n\\nWe've got some assets and the like.\\n\\nWe'll keep the configuration.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo we'll leave all that there.\\n\\nIt's all good.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nAnd we'll have, so we've got the MDX there.\\n\\nThat's okay.\\n\\nGot the header file.\\n\\nLet's see.\\n\\nIt says, probably going to make a new one anyway.\\n\\nSo I'll do that.\\n\\nActually, it wants to add a module, don't I?\\n\\nSo we're going to use CCS modules on this project.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo I've got the module there.\\n\\nWe've got the stories.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nWe've got the configuration.\\n\\nAnd a few others in here.\\n\\nSo what I'm going to do, let's double check.\\n\\nI think these are being used in terms of the configuration.\\n\\nSo we'll leave the assets for the time being.\\n\\nWe'll have the configuration there.\\n\\nThis is because I don't have MDX as a file type, I believe.\\n\\nIt's not showing up correctly.\\n\\nLet's put it to JSX.\\n\\nNo, it's not going to, it's even worse.\\n\\nNo, I'm going to have to get some configuration for some plugin to do MDX at some point.\\n\\nI might just switch that back to plain text because it's a lot harder.\\n\\nThere we go.\\n\\nI'm going to keep that there.\\n\\nI'm going to take away, I mean, buttons are good, but these aren't the buttons that we're going to use.\\n\\nSo let's take those out.\\n\\nRemove those.\\n\\nHopefully this isn't going to break.\\n\\nNo, it's going to break it a little bit.\\n\\nI'm going to have to stop it in a sec.\\n\\nAnd we're going to have a header here and a page, stories as well.\\n\\nSo let's remove all those.\\n\\nAnd even more errors.\\n\\nYay.\\n\\nOkay, so I'll stop everything.\\n\\nThat's fine.\\n\\nWe can always start it up again.\\n\\nSo now I've sort of pulled back what we had in our stories folder to be a little bit less over the top in terms of having it all sort of dumped in one place.\\n\\nSo I'm going to keep mine in my components folder.\\n\\nI may at some point actually make separate folders for each one.\\n\\nLet's sort of see how we go.\\n\\nOkay, let's run this up.\\n\\nOkay, so we have our storybook NPM script down here.\\n\\nLet's run that.\\n\\nSo let's go kick off the storybook and it's going to run the dev there.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo periodically, that all should be good.\\n\\nLet's switch back to Chrome.\\n\\nMake sure that that is the case.\\n\\nOkay, and let's switch to.\\n\\nWe've got some red errors.\\n\\nThat's all cool.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nWe've got the docs there.\\n\\nWe've got the logged in unable to read a story.\\n\\nIt's confirmed and it's missing from the default export and the same for that as well.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo what have we done wrong?\\n\\nIt's always good to take a look back at what our code base is complaining about.\\n\\nLet's switch back to code.\\n\\nNow, cool thing is it's working.\\n\\nOkay, so we've probably got an import problem.\\n\\nYes, we do.\\n\\nWe've got a export header imported as header was not found in header possible exports default.\\n\\nLet's go back and take a look at our story.\\n\\nSo what is expecting in here?\\n\\nWe've got our header like so and our header.\\n\\njs file.\\n\\nExport default function header.\\n\\nOkay, so what's gone wrong?\\n\\nWhat could that possibly be?\\n\\nIt's saying export header imported as header was not found in .\\n\\nheader.\\n\\nExport.\\n\\nSo, okay.\\n\\nSo what is actually happening?\\n\\nAnd our export default here, that's where we are having the issue.\\n\\nSo let's have a look.\\n\\nWe can go back and actually have a look at what the previous one was.\\n\\nWe can do so by looking at.\\n\\nBecause we've deleted it now, of course.\\n\\nSo we go back to Chrome itself.\\n\\nAnd if we have a look at sort of an example.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo what's happening is in our component, we are exporting it as default rather than exporting it as header.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nStorybook doesn't like that.\\n\\nSo we need to change our code to do that.\\n\\nLet's go back to code.\\n\\nOkay, so.\\n\\nWe can just have a function header.\\n\\nExport default header, like so.\\n\\nOops.\\n\\nOkay, so that's rebuilding again.\\n\\nI've got that export default header.\\n\\nAnd let's go back to Chrome.\\n\\nStill got the same issue.\\n\\nSo what have I done wrong?\\n\\nOkay, I still haven't done this correctly.\\n\\nI should be exporting it differently.\\n\\nUnable to render story is component annotation is missing from the default export.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo.\\n\\nCan't.\\n\\nIt has a anonymous function there, like so.\\n\\nI changed my keyboard, so I'm a little bit clumsy on the keys at the moment.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSwitch back to Chrome.\\n\\nStill not gonna issue.\\n\\nWhat would I do to solve this?\\n\\nThis is like a great question.\\n\\nYou are gonna have times when you will not be able to sort of see what is happening.\\n\\nSo it's really good to figure out how to solve these issues.\\n\\nOkay, so what have I done wrong?\\n\\nYou know, let's probably.\\n\\nWhat's one way I could find out why that is not working?\\n\\nWell, example here is component annotation is missing from the default export.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nWhy is it complaining about that?\\n\\nThat's a good question.\\n\\nIs there something wrong with my code or is there something wrong with my configuration?\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nThere is multiple ways that we can create components.\\n\\nThey don't have to all have, I guess, this normal export default function style, which is very common from Next.js.\\n\\nIt's like the sort of the default there.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nYeah, so it's got the same.\\n\\nif we look at our different components, they are similar.\\n\\nSo what could we do?\\n\\nWe could always go back and have a look at a previous project.\\n\\nThat's a perfectly great way to do that.\\n\\nI know I've got something already set up.\\n\\nIf we go to my blog.\\n\\nNow, under my articles here.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nUI component library.\\n\\nLike I said, I previously created a video on using Storybook before.\\n\\nSo it's very much the same sort of structure.\\n\\nOkay, so using the buttons.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo if we look at the project, we can actually get an idea of how it was working.\\n\\nI've got some typescripts, but that's okay.\\n\\nSo we've got this project.\\n\\nI've got the source.\\n\\nLet's go to the components.\\n\\nIf only nothing is hitting component already.\\n\\nSo export constant hitting.\\n\\nSo that's where I went wrong.\\n\\nSo I was still exporting as default when I should be exporting as the named value of the component.\\n\\nSo let's go and jump back to the likes of our code.\\n\\nSo let's do that.\\n\\nJust before we do that, though, I'm going to copy and paste.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nBecause I can.\\n\\nSwitch back.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nAgain, this is typescript.\\n\\nSo I'm not going to have any of these values inside of the properties as typed values.\\n\\nInstead, I just need it like that.\\n\\nLike that.\\n\\nI don't need the export default.\\n\\nNow, will we have to stop start it?\\n\\nProbably.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo why is that not leaking?\\n\\nExport constant header.\\n\\nExport constant hitting.\\n\\nNow, stories.\\n\\nThis might help.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nWhat can we do?\\n\\nWhat can we do?\\n\\nObviously, there's something I am not noticing.\\n\\nThat's okay, though.\\n\\nAfter battle of software development is trying to figure things out.\\n\\nWe're not going to get put off already.\\n\\nSo we can do that.\\n\\nSo we've got the import from the header.\\n\\nI'm going to go back and take a look at my story.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo we've got the import, the header.\\n\\nWe're taking that from our header.\\n\\nTake a deep breath.\\n\\nWell, that couldn't be a bit of a problem.\\n\\nSo we've got hitting.\\n\\nI should have had export constant header.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nAnd let's switch back to code now.\\n\\nAnd here's where I went wrong.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nOh, good.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo what did I do wrong?\\n\\nI wasn't exporting a default.\\n\\nI was expecting a default with JavaScript.\\n\\nI named my component wrong.\\n\\nSo I called it heading instead of header.\\n\\nSo be careful about silly things like that.\\n\\nIt's very easy to get tripped up over that kind of stuff.\\n\\nThat is part of the course.\\n\\nThat is what happens.\\n\\nWe all make silly mistakes like that.\\n\\nDon't see anyone popping up in the comments pointing out we're undone something wrong.\\n\\nThat's okay.\\n\\nBe happy if you guys shout out if there's anything that is not working correctly or you can be going, hey, do that silly.\\n\\nYeah, please shout it out in the comments.\\n\\nThat would be helpful for me.\\n\\nEven after all these years, I still make plenty of mistakes.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo we've got the header.\\n\\nWe've got the default header there.\\n\\nWe've got the stories.\\n\\nSo we've got our example.\\n\\nI'm not a big fan of saying example.\\n\\nI'm just going to say components.\\n\\nHopefully this is not going to break it.\\n\\nLet's refresh.\\n\\nYeah, no, it's complaining now.\\n\\nOkay, so you kind of need to take that path out.\\n\\nThe path is, of course, got the name.\\n\\nThere.\\n\\nIt's okay.\\n\\nNow it's called components.\\n\\nIt's got header.\\n\\nIt's got our docs.\\n\\nIt's got our logged in, logged out.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nOkay, so I'm happy with that now.\\n\\nIt's looking a little bit better.\\n\\nSwitch back to the likes of code.\\n\\nOkay, so I just renamed that total there.\\n\\nSo now it's components and header.\\n\\nAnd that way we won't have.\\n\\nOh no, it's not like a big fan of having example there.\\n\\nIt's not particularly cool.\\n\\nAll right.\\n\\nComponents, header.\\n\\nGot my name.\\n\\nI've got a logged in state, a logged out state.\\n\\nDo I need that?\\n\\nProbably not.\\n\\nI'm just going to call one default.\\n\\nThat's where we can complain.\\n\\nAnd I can get rid of the logged in out state now.\\n\\nSwitch back.\\n\\nIt's probably going to be complaining.\\n\\nLet's see.\\n\\nIs it?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nAh, nice.\\n\\nBecause I was on the docs one, it didn't complain.\\n\\nGot to watch out for these paths in the URL bar here.\\n\\nBecause if you.\\n\\nIt's just literally using them as parameters in a query string.\\n\\nSo if they're not correct, then of course the page isn't going to load.\\n\\nSo if you change the name or something, it is going to impact on it.\\n\\nSo watch out for that.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo I've got my header.\\n\\nI just got the default.\\n\\nAgain, there's not much to it.\\n\\nGoing and taking a look at our scull drawer.\\n\\nLet's take a look at what we created as our look and feel.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo we've got the.\\n\\nWhat we call it?\\n\\nThe.\\n\\nLogo.\\n\\nWe've got a menu.\\n\\nAnd that's pretty much it.\\n\\nThe menu will sit on the right hand side.\\n\\nThe logo on the left.\\n\\nIt's the same throughout the different sizes.\\n\\nSo our mobile tablet view and on a desktop view.\\n\\nThe top bar here of this header will continue to reach out to the full width of its size.\\n\\nSo what can we do about that?\\n\\nLet's place.\\n\\nMaybe let's just make a logo.\\n\\nI'm just going to put a placeholder in, which is fine for the time being.\\n\\nWhat we have here.\\n\\nSo we've got a header.\\n\\nI'm just going to be really original and jump back into our code.\\n\\nAnd I'm going to call it LMS.\\n\\nSo that's our logo as such.\\n\\nSo I'm going to give that a div.\\n\\nAnd then we'll put a name.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo now we've got our logo.\\n\\nAnd then we're going to put the menu in in a sec.\\n\\nSwitch back to the likes of Chrome.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nSo that's updated.\\n\\nWe're starting to get there.\\n\\nWell if we want to actually start doing any styling, there's one thing that we need to do.\\n\\nBecause at the moment it's just using sort of default font sizes and default fonts.\\n\\nSo if we look at that, yeah, it's just coming directly from the user agent style sheet, which is the browser itself.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nLet's switch back to code.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo we've got LMS there.\\n\\nI've made this module, CSS module here.\\n\\nSo we need to import that.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo the best thing sometimes is to find an example.\\n\\nLet's see if we can find a file for a module.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nSo we've got an example there.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nLet's do the same.\\n\\nSo in our header, we're going to need to import the header.\\n\\nmodule.\\n\\ncss file.\\n\\nIt's going to import it as styles and then we're going to be able to use this in our styling.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo back to our header component.\\n\\nImport styles from, and this is going to be just the local file there.\\n\\nHeader module.\\n\\ncss, like so.\\n\\nAnd then we can do something like this.\\n\\nClass name.\\n\\nWe're going to be using a JavaScript variable because it's styles and we can have our header.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nAnd we can do the same for the logo.\\n\\nSo copy that bit.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo jumping back to VS Code, Chrome, sorry.\\n\\nWe should now have that loading and let's actually add some styles to that so that we can actually see that.\\n\\nThat is correctly working.\\n\\nSo let's go to our style sheet.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nAnd we've got logo there.\\n\\nFont family.\\n\\nI'm actually just going to keep it real generic and switch it to sort of a sans-serif.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nAnd then we should be able to switch back.\\n\\nNow.\\n\\nlogo.\\n\\nJust going to do just to make sure that it's displaying correctly.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo probably got.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nWhat have I done wrong?\\n\\nWell, we've got a background.\\n\\nWe've got a color there.\\n\\nWe've not got it unpacking on the font.\\n\\nProbably because H1.\\n\\nI don't know.\\n\\nWell, there you go.\\n\\nSo no quotes.\\n\\nMy bad.\\n\\nI don't know why I decided to do that.\\n\\nSometimes you do some weird things sometimes.\\n\\nI'm going to take those off.\\n\\nIt's going to be inherited.\\n\\nI'm going to get rid of the background color there.\\n\\nAnd we should have another one for the header.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo thinking about our designs.\\n\\nPretty basic.\\n\\nHad a border radius.\\n\\nAnd it's, you know, I say one rim.\\n\\nIt's probably too big actually.\\n\\n0.5 rem.\\n\\nBorder radius.\\n\\nWe're going to need background color.\\n\\nWhat could we have?\\n\\nWe could have maybe, I don't know, what's a cool color.\\n\\nWe're actually, because we've only done it as wireframes there, we've got no sort of look and feel coming on yet.\\n\\nLet's pick something.\\n\\nProbably a bit too pink.\\n\\nMaybe.\\n\\nThat's not cool.\\n\\nToo bright.\\n\\nNot a big header of that.\\n\\nSo you can see there, it's got a little, yeah, that could work.\\n\\nSort of olivey green.\\n\\nYeah, I'm cool with that.\\n\\nAnd then I'm going to add some padding.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nMaybe it didn't, I could go bigger.\\n\\nYou know, we could be a bit more chunky.\\n\\nLet's make it one rim there.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nOkay, so we can see there in our component, we're getting these CSS module class names are coming through.\\n\\nCool thing about CSS modules is that it will get a unique name there every time it is rendered.\\n\\nThat's built into the next JS.\\n\\nSo what it's doing is going through a build process, putting, appending a unique identifier on the end of the class.\\n\\nIt uses the component name and then followed by the class name that you have in your module folder with the underscore.\\n\\nAnd then of course the unique identifier.\\n\\nThat way, it should always be unique and you shouldn't get any CSS sort of clashes with that.\\n\\nSo one of the benefits of using CSS modules.\\n\\nThe other cool side of that, because everything has been put inside its own file.\\n\\nWhen you come to get rid of the component, you can feel comfortable in removing that CSS file at the same time.\\n\\nIt's got some cons.\\n\\nOne being, you could end up with a, if you're not diligent about your CSS styling, you could end up with a whole lot of repeated sort of classes in those individual modules.\\n\\nSo you may need at some point to go back and refactor and pull those out, maybe into a global style sheet that you're using throughout your project.\\n\\nJust so that you're not reinventing everything.\\n\\nBut yeah, it all comes down to preferences.\\n\\nIt's not right or wrong way.\\n\\nIt's just sort of strengths and weaknesses and pros and cons.\\n\\nOkay, so we've got the LMS there.\\n\\nIf we take a look at the browser.\\n\\nCool, cool.\\n\\nOkay, it's going to move the browser down a little bit.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nRight, and so we've got our components, got our logo.\\n\\nIf we switch back to the code there, we've got our CSS classes and alike.\\n\\nBorder radius background color padding, our font style itself.\\n\\nWe've got the, we're just using the black default color there.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nOkay, so that's starting to come together.\\n\\nOkay, so we've got that come together and go switch back to Chrome now.\\n\\nOkay, now I haven't placed this.\\n\\nWell, start us there's two things I am not running the project at the moment so it's for we're just going to crash now.\\n\\nI'm only running the storybook.\\n\\nSecondly, our header component does not sit in any of our actual layout for the app itself yet.\\n\\nIt's purely sitting standalone and our storybook.\\n\\nCool thing about that is that because it's standalone in our storybook, we can do a few things inside of our storybook here and we can sort of test for likes of different sizes.\\n\\nSo if you actually have a look here, it looks like a cool thing.\\n\\nThat's working correctly.\\n\\nSo we've got the small.\\n\\nWe can do that.\\n\\nOkay, so we have small mobile layer so we can actually have a small view of it.\\n\\nWe can have a large mobile tablet and sort of reset it can be like it is top.\\n\\nSo it's all there.\\n\\nQuite cool.\\n\\nWe've also got the likes of what else we got here.\\n\\nWe've got the flight grid view.\\n\\nSo you can see it's good for the background.\\n\\nYou can change the background or preview for an image there if you would like.\\n\\nThere's a ruler just really cool to the showing.\\n\\nSo using sort of one room there, which is 16 pixels in this case for our padding.\\n\\nAnd you can see that is displayed there with the measurements plug in.\\n\\nThis is all this is all default to a storybook.\\n\\nWe haven't had to add these as separate notice.\\n\\nAlso, it's got a little refresh here so you can remount it.\\n\\nWhich is pretty cool.\\n\\nAnd you've even got a sort of zoom so you can zoom in on your components.\\n\\nReset it.\\n\\nIt's pretty cool.\\n\\nYou can also sort of add these outlines as well, which is again, we're really nice.\\n\\nIt's a good way to just visually see how your component is built as well.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nOK, so go to LMS.\\n\\nWe have our logo.\\n\\nNow at the start of the project, cast your mind back.\\n\\nI imported the Radix components.\\n\\nSo let's just double check that that's all up and going.\\n\\nSo if we go into project here, we have the Radix UI theme.\\n\\nOK, so we're using that in our project.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nSo what I'm going to do is what you should always do when you are working on projects.\\n\\nTry to commit often.\\n\\nI think we're at a good point.\\n\\nWe've got it.\\n\\nWe've got storybook set up.\\n\\nWe've got our header component displaying.\\n\\nWe know that our CSS modules are working correctly.\\n\\nAnd we can actually check that in now, feel confident that it's looking pretty good.\\n\\nSo let's do that.\\n\\nSo I added a storybook.\\n\\nProject.\\n\\nAnd set up header component.\\n\\nSo commit that.\\n\\nAnd we'll sync those changes.\\n\\nAwesome.\\n\\nLike I said, we've got Radix there.\\n\\nIf we jump back to the likes of Chrome.\\n\\nLet's do that.\\n\\nSo.\\n\\nGot our LMS.\\n\\nNow, let's go and take a look at the Radix UI library again.\\n\\nOK.\\n\\nSo we've already done this part.\\n\\nWe've already set this up.\\n\\nPart of our project.\\n\\nNow, the reason we're using this library, we've got a whole lot of pre-configured components that we can use out of the box.\\n\\nWe don't have to start from scratch.\\n\\nSo that's why we're using them.\\n\\nAnother good important point about them is they have some good defaults already set up in terms of accessibility.\\n\\nSo we can continue with that.\\n\\nOK, so let's go down to this layout here.\\n\\nWhat do we got out of the box here?\\n\\nLet's just have a quick look through.\\n\\nSo we've got, let's get the overview of the theme.\\n\\nSo the theme has the colors there.\\n\\nSo you can configure that.\\n\\nSo that's currently we have that configured.\\n\\nNo, I think it's just using the defaults completely at the moment, which is fine.\\n\\nSo we can set all those things, which is pretty cool.\\n\\nWe've done something already that we probably shouldn't know if we set the radius.\\n\\nSo there's an ability there to do all that as well.\\n\\nColors, etc.\\n\\nThat's OK.\\n\\nWe can just undo those.\\n\\nSo pretty cool.\\n\\nIt's already got quite a lot of color scales and lights set up.\\n\\nWe've got a dark mode already, which is pretty cool.\\n\\nSo we'll be able to add that as needed.\\n\\nVisual style, panel background.\\n\\nSo we've got panel elements there.\\n\\nSo we can have a translucent.\\n\\nWe can have it solid, etc.\\n\\nVery cool.\\n\\nThe typography.\\n\\nIt's all pretty much set up and done for you.\\n\\nPretty awesome.\\n\\nLayout.\\n\\nOK.\\n\\nWe could just use our own CSS to perform our layout.\\n\\nBut one of the benefits of using something like this library is that we can use that to instead have that consistency.\\n\\nWe can sort of step back and just have our CSS modules for the styling of things which are completely custom, which aren't as part of the Radix UI.\\n\\nSo we'll use what we've already got set up here.\\n\\nSo there is some layout components already.\\n\\nWe've got a box, flex and grid, which is awesome.\\n\\nSo we can set up our.\\n\\nlooking back to our design.\\n\\nOK.\\n\\nPretty basic setup.\\n\\nLogo on the left, menu on the right.\\n\\nWe want to do that sort of layout.\\n\\nSo a good way that we could do that, we could use maybe the flex layout, which would allow us to do that quite easily.\\n\\nWe could actually use a good layout as well.\\n\\nProbably not needed.\\n\\nI'm just going to have the flex, have the logo on the left and the menu on the right.\\n\\nBut also know, I believe there is a menu already.\\n\\nIt's a right click one, so that's not the one we'll have after.\\n\\nI think there's a nav.\\n\\nLet's see.\\n\\nDrop down menu, components, tabs.\\n\\nWe want tabs, we want.\\n\\nWe just want a list of menu items.\\n\\nDrop down menu.\\n\\nScroll area separator.\\n\\nCould use that.\\n\\nLet's go take a look back at the playground, I think.\\n\\nIt's always good to do that.\\n\\nOK, so playground.\\n\\nWe've got some sort of menu up here that could be useful.\\n\\nLet's have a look at the playground.\\n\\nLike I said, the themes all set up like that.\\n\\nReally cool little side note here.\\n\\nYou can see on the right hand side we've got a whole theme builder in this playground.\\n\\nWe can literally copy that theme, apply that to our theme provider and then we'll be set to go.\\n\\nIt would look the same as what we're doing in here.\\n\\nSo where was those?\\n\\nThere's the tabs.\\n\\nThere's the links there.\\n\\nLet's see if we can find it.\\n\\nSeparator, slider, tabs, text area, text field, tooltip.\\n\\nThey just use buttons.\\n\\nCan I use these badges?\\n\\nLet's see what they actually are.\\n\\nProduct link.\\n\\nProduct link container.\\n\\nMaybe we will have to put our own menu.\\n\\nOK.\\n\\nAlways the fun part of working with any new project.\\n\\nThis is the first time I've used Radix UI.\\n\\nI wanted to give it a try.\\n\\nA bonus of that is you get to see me fumble around.\\n\\nJust like you guys would if you hadn't used it as well.\\n\\nSo we've got the tabs there.\\n\\nI'm not really a big fan of doing that for the tabs.\\n\\nI want the actual menu structure to be something that's going to work.\\n\\nIt's going to work well on a mobile.\\n\\nI don't think we need a context menu like that.\\n\\nI don't think that's really going to be helpful.\\n\\nAnd I'm not a big fan of that.\\n\\nMaybe if we're more sort of app-based, rather than an LMS, maybe I would use that.\\n\\nI think we could just have a selection of menu items.\\n\\nOK.\\n\\nWe may actually end up having to use some of the Existings.\\n\\nAnd we can take a look at the parameters here.\\n\\nSo the other thing we've also got available to us is the ability to take these parameters.\\n\\nAnd we can use these as well.\\n\\nWe'll take a quick look at what's in here.\\n\\nSwitch back.\\n\\nOK.\\n\\nIt's going to take a break for a few minutes.\\n\\nAnd then we'll come back and we'll start deciding how we're going to make our menu.\\n\\nOK.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nI'm back.\\n\\nOkay, I'm back.\\n\\nOkay, so we've got some examples here.\\n\\nI'm quite a fan of these sort of links here.\\n\\nI don't believe that they're using anything that's out of the ordinary.\\n\\nSo we could just create our own ones like that.\\n\\nIt's not a silly idea.\\n\\nLet's take a look at them further.\\n\\nAren't they being built with anything special in mind there?\\n\\nOkay, so we've got inactive state.\\n\\nLink there, we've got here to product link inner.\\n\\nSo it looks like we've just got some custom styling here anyway.\\n\\nWe have the looks of it.\\n\\nAnd not something that's already available there, which is fine.\\n\\nWe can use that.\\n\\nSo our buttons, like so.\\n\\nSomething like that.\\n\\nIt's a button.\\n\\nI wonder if it's a context menu.\\n\\nSo it's like a trigger one.\\n\\nThe drop down menu is more, again, it's a button like so.\\n\\nWe could just have them as buttons.\\n\\nThat's one way we could do it.\\n\\nWe just probably want them.\\n\\nLet's just links I think.\\n\\nText field, text area, tabs.\\n\\nYeah, I think I'm going to create them with a similar look as what we are used to.\\n\\nDoes it have any advice on that in the documentation?\\n\\nThat's a good question.\\n\\nAdd the theme components, start building, customizing your theme, using the theme panel.\\n\\nSo called this radius there.\\n\\nI think we can actually get a lot of these custom CSS properties.\\n\\nRadix exposes themes, all tokens as CSS custom properties.\\n\\nSo this is the Radix way where we can take what's already part of that themeing structure.\\n\\nAnd we can actually incorporate it into our own custom styles, which is pretty cool.\\n\\nWe're going to apply a theme to this project using Radix.\\n\\nRadix is UI themes.\\n\\nAnd then what we can do from there is we can take these tokens and actually apply them across our CSS.\\n\\nSo for a comprehensive list of all available tokens, see their respective source files.\\n\\nSo say like in the case of our radius.\\n\\nNo, not so much.\\n\\nThink about it maybe in terms of our color.\\n\\nOK.\\n\\nSo this is all the theme colors here.\\n\\nSo with that, we would have a color of amber.\\n\\nThese are all the tokens.\\n\\nWe go back to the help.\\n\\nLet's see.\\n\\nSo they got T file font size.\\n\\nSo if we grab this, that's the modifying of it, but we'd be able to see all the tokens like that.\\n\\nOK, so we can use these for our project.\\n\\nSo we've got font size one.\\n\\nWe've got weight, bold, default font family.\\n\\nIt's a whole lot there is accessible to us.\\n\\nWe can grab these as the CSS variables that they are.\\n\\nAnd we can apply it to our own styling.\\n\\nSo let's give it actually a try just to test that out.\\n\\nIf we take a look at some of the colors there.\\n\\nRadix colors, tomato.\\n\\nSo you see, this is the color called tomato.\\n\\nLet's put the end here.\\n\\nSearch for it.\\n\\nLet's say, tomato.\\n\\nThat's CSS.\\n\\nIt has not come up with the one I was expecting.\\n\\nI'm not saying that.\\n\\nThat's weird.\\n\\nGet Radix UI themes, components, helpers, styles, tokens, color.\\n\\nHere we go.\\n\\nOK, so all these are embedded in here.\\n\\nLet's give an example of a component.\\n\\nToken reference, CSS custom properties.\\n\\nWe've got the box layout there.\\n\\nThat's so cool.\\n\\nIt's got these surface colors.\\n\\nGrab this.\\n\\nGo into our code.\\n\\nGo into the header module that says this file.\\n\\nWhat I'm going to do is I'm going to replace that token.\\n\\nIt's variable.\\n\\nOK.\\n\\nLet's go have a look at our storybook now.\\n\\nDid that impact on it?\\n\\nNo, it did not.\\n\\nOK.\\n\\nLet's see what actually came out.\\n\\nYeah, it doesn't.\\n\\nDidn't actually even get that color.\\n\\nMaybe that's not being exposed at the top level.\\n\\nDoes the contrast background and text.\\n\\nFocus selection, color scheme.\\n\\nOK, so it was for the X into the loan.\\n\\nLet's try that.\\n\\nMaybe this one's exposed.\\n\\nGood question.\\n\\nWhy would it be?\\n\\nBy default, we would have to actually do that.\\n\\nOK.\\n\\nWhat are we at?\\n\\nWe are at an hour and a half.\\n\\nAnd I'm running out of time.\\n\\nSo what we can do next time we come back to the project, we can further explore how we can get, I guess, the Radix UI theming into our storybook.\\n\\nBecause at the moment, it doesn't actually seem like we're actually getting, we are getting our custom styles from the modules, but we're not getting our custom styles from the Radix UI because we're not embedding anything.\\n\\nSo a quick way we could quickly test that maybe is add a button.\\n\\nBut we have run out of time, unfortunately.\\n\\nSo next time what I'll do is configure using the Radix UI buttons.\\n\\nWe'll test the theming and structure out.\\n\\nBut have a play yourself.\\n\\nStorybook's really good for doing this building of components in isolation.\\n\\nIt's got some great testing tools.\\n\\nIt's also got some accessibility tools built in as well.\\n\\nHave a check of those.\\n\\nSome of those are really great.\\n\\nAnd of course you can have all your properties based on, if you want to have like we had before, we had the primary button and the non-primary button by setting that boolean value.\\n\\nThen it was going to show that color, the accent color on our buttons.\\n\\nCool stuff.\\n\\nSo next time, like I said, we'll get that Radix UI set up and we'll go through and make sure that it's working and continue on with our header component.\\n\\nAlright, thank you for watching.\\n\\nPlease remember to like and subscribe.\\n\\nAnd if you want, you can ring the bell.\\n\\nYou'll get notified when I do come online again.\\n\\nHave a great day and I will catch you all later.\\n\\nBye.\\n\\n_Please note this transcript was edited for

Supabase. Andrew discusses how to display a list of courses on a webpage using data from a Supabase database. He explains how to use SQL queries to retrieve data from the database and display it on the webpage and also mentions using Superbase's table editor to edit the database and provides a brief overview of plans for future development.\\nogimage: \\\"full-stack3.jpg\\\"\\n---\\n\\n{% figure \\\"./full-stack3.jpg\\\", \\\"&quot;A web full-stack app built with NextJS&quot; / Bing Image Creator\\\" %}\\n\\nThe following is a transcript of my live stream on YouTube Sep 28, 2023 on Building a Full-Stack web app with Next.js. This is the third video in the series where I use Supabase as the database for the app. In the video I create a table to hold our courses. I then load it with some data of some course names and then finally display the results of the data in a list.\\n\\nThe project is available on GitHub as LMS NextJS.\\n\\nyoutube.com/embed/LCnHOpg7U7s?si=4nK2Xr8rFvh9TuWr\\n\\n---\\n\\nAlright, hey there.\\n\\nOkay, so this stream is going to be on using Superbase.\\n\\nWe're going to continue on with the rest of the stream, I guess, with trying to build an XJS app from scratch.\\n\\nAnd we've gone through the planning stages already.\\n\\nset up the React app using XJS and we're now at the point where we are going to set up the database.\\n\\nSo how are we going to do this?\\n\\nWell first things, let's jump to the Superbase website because it's got a really good walkthrough there of a quick start.\\n\\nOkay, so you can see here it's got the likes of Superbase with XJS.\\n\\nThat's what we're using It's asking for creating a new project on the Superbase dashboard Okay, and goes through the process of setting up a table in the database Okay, so if we go to the Superbase dashboard Okay, so I've got this this is my project the LMS one And I've got no tables in it at present.\\n\\nSo I'm gonna create a new table just like the guide showed us and I'm gonna insert some data into it as well Of course on this one, I'm not gonna be adding countries.\\n\\nI am going to be adding some courses for the LMS So let's go and do so So create a new table.\\n\\nNo, you want to pluralize the name of course, so courses.\\n\\nI'll disable RLS for now.\\n\\nYou probably wouldn't want to do this.\\n\\nActually, no, I'll keep it on.\\n\\nLet's keep it on.\\n\\nI'll do something else instead.\\n\\nthinking through.\\n\\nSo we're gonna have the likes of a new public table, we're gonna have an ID and it's created at.\\n\\nThis is a nice little simple user interface.\\n\\nYou can do the same using some SQL but the interface is pretty good in terms of that.\\n\\nSo let's do that.\\n\\nOkay so we're gonna need a few things I guess for a course name, a course name, so I'm going to have a name here and it's going to be some text.\\n\\nOr Basha, Basha probably would be better.\\n\\nAnd I'm going to add a description.\\n\\nAgain, this one I will actually make a text.\\n\\nAnd I'm going to add another column here for some.\\n\\nWe need to have an image, I think.\\n\\nLet's do that.\\n\\nNow, I think it could have us as some data, but probably the easiest thing to do in this scenario.\\n\\nOf course, we don't want to to load out a database or anything like that.\\n\\nSuperbase doesn't really give you the option there to add the data directly to it, but we can instead add a virtual character string length there and then we can have the image URL.\\n\\nWe would use some sort of some storage system to save that into a database.\\n\\nOkay, so we got an image, we got a name, we got a description, we got the created at let's save that.\\n\\nOkay, so we should shortly see it loading up the table.\\n\\nHere we go.\\n\\nOkay, so we've got no data in here at the moment.\\n\\nWe've got a name, a description, an image, an ID, and this table here.\\n\\nSo going back to the guide, we can actually start adding some values to our table.\\n\\nSo there's a SQL Editor to do that.\\n\\nLet's start off with that.\\n\\nOkay, so on the left hand side here, you've got sort of the table editor and then you've got the SQL editor If we open that up And this is the new AI stuff We'll do just a new query Okay Is that That's just confusing I'm having some trouble with the entering there.\\n\\nI don't know where that is.\\n\\nAnyway, let's insert some data.\\n\\nSo this was the last time I've done this before.\\n\\nSo we're going to insert into the courses table.\\n\\nand set into name, that's what we're going to add.\\n\\nAnd grab that, and just change it.\\n\\nOkay, so we've got a name there and the value is going to be ReactForBeginner.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nThis is setting the change.\\n\\nThis is quite cool.\\n\\nI haven't seen this before.\\n\\nSo this is, yeah that's pretty cool.\\n\\nAI way to add data to your database.\\n\\nGetting the, well, instead of having to do it as a insert there, I could have probably say add name value called to the table there.\\n\\nLet's try that.\\n\\nSet that change.\\n\\nIs that going to let me?\\n\\nHm, it's not getting so.\\n\\nI don't know why that's not letting me.\\n\\nWeird.\\n\\nThis is not making this easy.\\n\\nOh, okay.\\n\\nSo it's like it's not letting me actually edit this.\\n\\nThis is great.\\n\\nHmm.\\n\\nMaybe I found a bug?\\n\\nMaybe I have.\\n\\nNot to worry.\\n\\nLet's see what it says.\\n\\nSo include an almost stardomirter and aqueurries.\\n\\nLet's see if it will let us execute it then.\\n\\nNo!\\n\\nI wonder why this is breaking.\\n\\nIt's not to worry, let's refresh this.\\n\\nand new course named 'grat.\\n\\njs4beginners' It's kind of weird it popped up with the accept there and.\\n\\nI am not having luck today am I?\\n\\nAh here we go.\\n\\nSo accept that.\\n\\nOkay now I can do this.\\n\\nLet's hopefully I can run this and it should add this to my database.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nSuccess, that's good.\\n\\nLet's go back to our table view.\\n\\nClose that one.\\n\\nAnd we'll open that.\\n\\nOkay, so straight away we've got some new data now in our table.\\n\\nWe've got the record there for reHJS.\\n\\nWe've got no description or image yet, but we can start adding some more records in here.\\n\\nJust to get something this way on the page once we list out these from the database.\\n\\nI'm going to go back to the edit there.\\n\\nI'm going to add another one we have.\\n\\nCSS Okay, so that's going to add that record on as well and we'll do it one more What's number one HTML 5 HTML was new.\\n\\nOkay, cool, so that's added.\\n\\nAnd if we go back to our table view, sure enough, we've got those three records now.\\n\\nWe've got a name there for each of them.\\n\\nIt's almost a dimension description, but we can add that in later.\\n\\nOkay, let's go back to the guide here.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nAnd we can see here that we've got.\\n\\nI haven't seen that before on the hopper now.\\n\\nIt shows you how much memory each tab is using.\\n\\nPretty cool.\\n\\nI haven't seen that before.\\n\\nThat's all good.\\n\\nOkay, so we've got these three records now and our table.\\n\\nJust a similar example here with the countries.\\n\\nWe're not going to do the create next tab because we've already got it up and running.\\n\\nWe've already got that set up.\\n\\nWhat we will need to do, if you haven't already, is to create an EMV file.\\n\\nSo in the project on the GitHub, I actually already have this.\\n\\nLet's pop this up so you guys can see as well.\\n\\nLet me see.\\n\\nSo we've got this yellow mess here.\\n\\nOkay, so in here I have a local env example.\\n\\nSo what you're going to need to do is go into your settings for Superbase here, just like the link here, follow this link here, it'll take you to the API page, you'll have a URL you'll have an anonymous key.\\n\\nYou'll need to put those into an .\\n\\nenv file and something like that.\\n\\nnv.\\n\\nlocal, that's a good place to start.\\n\\nAdd those keys in there and that's what I've already done.\\n\\nSo if we look at my code.\\n\\nOkay, so just like I said, I've got an example file here, you'd add those keys in there.\\n\\nMake sure you stop and start so that you get your environment keys to load because without it your app won't reload the environment variables unless you do that.\\n\\nOkay so once you've done that you've added those keys in there.\\n\\nWe can go back to the tutorial.\\n\\nOkay and it's got an example here.\\n\\nThey've got a page that they've created, so countries page.\\n\\nOkay so that's for a type script file and what they've done is they've created a component, used the cookies there to import the header there and then it does a call off to the Superbase library and gets the countries for that.\\n\\nSo for those that maybe have done some SQL in the past it pretty much is very much a similar sort of look to SQL for Superbase.\\n\\nSo their whole, I guess their model for being able to retrieve from your tables, again using a from there, there's your word in the select statement, and you've got a this select statement at the end there, hand by default I believe, having no value in the actual brackets there means that you're going to get all the columns on the table.\\n\\nSo let's start something like this up, let's actually go and add something like this to our page.\\n\\nNow we can add a new page so it might be a good idea to have a courses page.\\n\\nSo I'm going to jump into this code.\\n\\nOkay so we've got our structure here on the right hand side.\\n\\nOkay so we've got an app And there is a page.\\n\\nSo what I can have is the same again.\\n\\nIf you haven't looked at the document page and system of Next.\\n\\njs, it has a quite basic setup in terms of the app router, layout being the actual what's going to be displayed in terms of layout, and page is the actual sort of content for it.\\n\\nSo if we look at layout there, we've got a layout we're loading in some styles etc.\\n\\nwhich is all cool.\\n\\nNow let's go and go and add a new folder.\\n\\nOkay, so the App Router works basically by having a new folder name and in it you can have a page file.\\n\\nSo I'm going to have a folder called countries.\\n\\nLike that.\\n\\nOkay, so we've got the countries and we're going to need a page file.\\n\\nAll right.\\n\\nAnd we're going to need to have a component on there.\\n\\nSo what would that look like?\\n\\nThat could be something along the lines of this maybe.\\n\\nSo we're just typing that out.\\n\\nWe're going to export a export default and we're going to need to have this be async because we're going to be pulling in data for this home component.\\n\\nMaybe I should just call it, call it horses.\\n\\nOkay and in that we will need to have, we're going to actually import the Superbase library.\\n\\nSo if you haven't, we probably should actually check to see if we've got this installed.\\n\\nAlways we won't be able to.\\n\\nYes I have installed it in the past.\\n\\nOkay So what you could do in terms of that is go to the command line, run npm install and superbase js and superbase auth help as an xjs as dependencies that look something like this.\\n\\nAnd we can take those same two libraries.\\n\\nSo the great thing about npm on the install command there is you can actually have multiple items in there.\\n\\nOkay, this shouldn't make much difference.\\n\\nAt least there's some version changes or something but yeah, looks like it's the same.\\n\\nSo those are now installed all of the project.\\n\\nI'm going to stop it and I'm now going to add my courses here.\\n\\nSo I need to import the server component client and the cookies header that was on that same tutorial on the Superbase website.\\n\\nLet's do that.\\n\\nOkay, directly copy from the tutorial there.\\n\\nI'll paste that into the notes as well so that we can see that if you guys are following along in the chat.\\n\\nOkay, awesome.\\n\\nAlright, so now we've got that set up.\\n\\nThe next thing we're gonna do is actually go and start setting this up.\\n\\nOkay, so we've got a courses component.\\n\\nWe need to render something, of course, from it.\\n\\nBut so we need to get the the server-based client first of all.\\n\\nWhat's looking here at what the co-pilot's trying to do, but no, we don't want to quite do that.\\n\\nThat's slightly different to what we want.\\n\\nAnd yeah, create the server-compliant client.\\n\\nI think it's got to be like this.\\n\\nOkay, so the cookie's there.\\n\\nand we then need to have a way to retrieve data.\\n\\nLook at that, it's actually even, it's copied the same bit of text there that is sitting on the, probably enough, the tutorial.\\n\\nWe're not going to grab from the countries, we're going to grab from the courses And like I mentioned before, it's very much like an SQL statement.\\n\\nSo you've got the from there, so the from from the table, and the select there.\\n\\nWe're just doing a wildcard, so that's going to return all those values.\\n\\nOkay, cool.\\n\\nOkay, we've got that running.\\n\\nWe can now do a return, because we want to actually display what we've got coming out of this.\\n\\nWe'll start off with some, maybe some nice semantic HTML here, maybe a main.\\n\\nOkay, I have a heading for it.\\n\\nSo thankfully, we have something like that.\\n\\nSo that's perfect.\\n\\nThat's pretty much done what we've got.\\n\\nOkay, so we've got the data We're mapping out the course We've got a key so that should be our database key items.\\n\\nSo that should be all nice and We've got the name itself Very cool.\\n\\nOkay, so let's save that I'm gonna run the deep super again and we can jump back to the browser Okay, so localhost 3000, that's not only a homepage, it's going to be in the courses page.\\n\\nSo if we loaded it, it would help probably if I had it under it.\\n\\nOkay, so what have I done wrong?\\n\\nI've got my countries.\\n\\nSo much following this tutorial that I actually named the folder of.\\n\\nThat will probably help.\\n\\nThere we go.\\n\\nWe've got our courses.\\n\\nBut what is not working?\\n\\nOkay, so looks like we're not getting anything displayed on the page and that's okay.\\n\\nI kind of expected that.\\n\\nAnd there's a reason for that.\\n\\nAnd it's basically to do with the security here for the app.\\n\\nSo what we need to do to make that accessible, we can do a couple of things, but probably the easiest one to do so is go into our table and what we can do for it is set the policies on it.\\n\\nOkay, let's view policies.\\n\\nAnd what we want to actually do is we want to make a new policy for this.\\n\\nThey've got some, this is basically Superbase's way of making sure that only information that's supposed to be accessible is accessible to the right users.\\n\\nAnd they've got these nice little policies here.\\n\\nSo in this one, it's basically just a template wizard.\\n\\nYou can select from one of these.\\n\\nSo in our case we actually want to say that the courses are easy to be seen from the, I guess from a non-logged in user.\\n\\nSo I do want to enable red axis to everyone here.\\n\\nSo if I use this template that's going to let me apply that.\\n\\nYou've got really granular control here with Superbase in it.\\n\\nyou can actually set what operations you can do and can't do.\\n\\nAnd in this case, it's pretty much all ready to go.\\n\\nSo I only want to be able to use a select there, and I want to just have that showing basically.\\n\\nThat's pretty much all I need.\\n\\nA good thing to do is read this when you get a chance, is the documentation.\\n\\nBut let's run this.\\n\\nOkay, so it's it's creating this policy Sent to public Okay So now that policy is saved.\\n\\nWe should be able to have read access now To our table what you do?\\n\\nWell, I'll have a list So we're getting them all the list of courses now Being displayed onto the page, which is pretty cool Not bad, not bad, okay So Pretty quickly we can pull sort of our database Tables directly from the likes of Superbase, it's made it very simple to do the likes of our select requests and unlike As you can imagine having a kind of syntax like this is also going to help stop being able to do sort of SQL injection and the likes So having the client Tool like this is pretty handy So what we've got we've got a list at the moment and unordered list and each list item we display the course name and We could have the description and the image so we could actually do something with that just sort of get some placeholders laid out.\\n\\nSo I'm going to give it at the moment, it's not really that semantic.\\n\\nWe need to give it some more meaning there.\\n\\nProbably use an h3 because I would probably suspect I'd use maybe another secondary heading maybe or subtitle all the likes.\\n\\nSo I'll use an h3 here.\\n\\nSo we've got our course name and I'm going to have a description.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nAnd we're also going to need an image there of course as well.\\n\\nOkay, here we go.\\n\\nAnd just like that, we've got our course name and an image.\\n\\nAwesome.\\n\\nOkay, let's go back.\\n\\nSorry, wasn't sharing that properly was I?\\n\\nIt doesn't seem to be showing the best code.\\n\\nDouble check that.\\n\\n[typing] Hmm, let's keep going on.\\n\\nStill not working.\\n\\nOkay, so let's.\\n\\nI'm going to play around with OBS.\\n\\nWhat is going on?\\n\\n[NOISE] Finally enough, let's pull in my notification center.\\n\\nAnd let's pull the code down instead.\\n\\nGet in there.\\n\\nWell this is a pain.\\n\\nNothing like having to do some changes on the block.\\n\\n[typing] Go.\\n\\nFixed it.\\n\\n[laughs] Water pang.\\n\\nOkay cool.\\n\\nOh good.\\n\\nOkay so hopefully you guys can see that again.\\n\\nLet's just walk right through what actually happened there.\\n\\nSo I've got a list item.\\n\\nListing through I've got a image.\\n\\nLike I said previously I need to get that image to display and I need to do the name.\\n\\nOkay so what have we got next?\\n\\nWe've got our course, we've got our image, we've got our h3 there, we've got our p-tab with the description, which is all cool.\\n\\nOkay and we move back in our app.\\n\\nAgain, I'm still having a lovely time of OBS tonight.\\n\\nOkay so it is not loading.\\n\\nLet's fix this up too.\\n\\nBear with me.\\n\\n[typing] Okay.\\n\\n[typing sounds] almost there.\\n\\nAs you can see there I've got the image now showing, I've got the description if there was one and the name of course being shown as a title.\\n\\nOkay let's swap that round, awesome.\\n\\nSorry about that.\\n\\nSo now you should be able to see that.\\n\\nLet's go back to code now.\\n\\nCome on.\\n\\nOkay so we've got a, like I said, the images that are hitting and the like.\\n\\nNow we need to start sort of thinking about how we're actually going to build this up as a component.\\n\\nSo we've got our image there, we've got our headings, we've got our description.\\n\\nLet's put some images in, maybe a description so that we can see that on our actual project.\\n\\nSo the cool thing is with Superbase is that it has like this whole view of the table there.\\n\\nYou know, it's literally like an editor in the cloud.\\n\\nYou can literally go straight to to the table editor there, click on the table, it's not that much different than say like Google Sheets or a spreadsheet of some sort and you can literally go and you can start editing there, which is quite cool.\\n\\non this one I'm going to say.\\n\\nOkay, so that should sit there.\\n\\nthere, that should be saved.\\n\\nOkay, if we go back to the app itself, sure enough, it calls the swine on

the page here.\\n\\nWe've not got any hot refresh, of course, for data, but as we reload it we can see there that it's got the likes of all those three descriptions that I've just placed on.\\n\\nOkay, so we've got to check on how that's looking under the skin and the HTML that's rendered out.\\n\\nOkay, so So yeah, sure, I've got image, H3 and PTAC.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nSo you can see it's quite easy to start creating all your tables that you require.\\n\\nWe can start building out the rest of our structure.\\n\\nAnd I'll probably call pause on this today.\\n\\nWe're probably at the sort of starting point of now actually getting to the nitty gritty of actually building elements into our app.\\n\\nSo we'll start creating some of these tables here.\\n\\nWhat I will do is I will also publish or any changes I've made and commit them and push to GitHub.\\n\\nFor those that are following along, you'd be able to pull down the latest version of the app and you'll be able to see where it is.\\n\\nAnd then what I might also do is I might actually grab the SQL for the tables and the data itself as well.\\n\\nSo if you want to pull them into your own version of it, you can do that as well.\\n\\nNext time I'm going to go over fleshing out more that data structure.\\n\\nSo what I'll do is we'll go into some database diagramming just so that we've got a clear picture and a head of what we are trying to build and then we'll implement that in Superbase.\\n\\nOkay, awesome.\\n\\nThanks for watching and we'll see you next time.\\n\\nPlease like and subscribe and thanks to all those that managed to get me to 100 subscribers greatly appreciate it.\\n\\nBut yeah, tell your friends and I will see you next time.\\n\\nBye.\\n\\n_Please note this transcript was edited for

We are using Create React App in this example but the steps are similar to ViteJS and NextJS. Run the following command:\\n\\n```shell\\nnpx create-react-app your-ui-library-name --template typescript\\n```\\n\\nThis will use CRA with the TypeScript template to create a new project.\\n\\nNext we will install Storybook. Make sure you are in the directory that contains your project using `cd your-ui-library-name`, replace `your-ui-library-name` with your own projects name.\\n\\n```shell\\nnpx storybook init\\n```\\n\\nThis will install Storybook in your project and add some default files.\\n\\nLet's get it running so we can make sure the installation went well.\\n\\n```shell\\nnpm run storybook\\n```\\n\\nYou should now see a welcome screen in your default browser like the following:\\n\\n{% image \\\"./storybook-welcome.png\\\", \\\"Storybook welcome screen\\\" %}\\n\\nWhen building a component UI library it's best to start building the smallest components that will make up the UI library. I suggest starting with some basic components like Headings & Buttons followed by common form controls. The storybook documentation on the welcome screen has a link to a great site quickly summarising component driven development.\\n\\nBy default, Storybook creates a folder called `stories` that contains component files, stories files and CSS files all matching the appropriate component name. For example `header.css`, `Header.tsx` and `Header.stories.tsx`.\\n\\nMy preference is to instead create a `components` and `pages` folder. In the components folder, I will have the component file, the stories file and the CSS module together as they are all part of the whole. I use the pages folder for the top-level components that are used by a router for example React Router. All my other components that are made up of the simple ones are also placed in the `components` folder, like a login form for example.\\n\\nWe are now going to copy the `button.css`, `Button.stories.tsx` and `Button.tsx` files into the `components` folder. This is a great example to start with for our Button component. Now you can delete the `stories` folder created by Storybook.\\n\\nCreate React App, NextJS etc support CSS Modules by default. CSS Modules let you use the same CSS class name in different files without worrying about naming clashes. Let's change this button component CSS file to `button.module.css`.\\nOpen `Button.tsx` and replace the reference to the `button.css` file with the following:\\n\\nFrom this:\\n\\n```ts\\nimport \\\"./button.css\\\";\\n```\\n\\nTo this:\\n\\n```ts\\nimport styles from \\\"./button.module.css\\\";\\n```\\n\\nIn the `Button.tsx` file you can see the properties for the component have been defined with `interface ButtonProps`. Notice the \\\"size\\\" with options of small, medium and large. We are going to make some adjustments to the CSS and logic of the component to work with CSS Modules.\\n\\nOpen the `button.module.css` file and rename the CSS classes from kebab-case to camelCase. We will also rename to a more generic name, by removing the \\\"storybook\\\" from the class names.\\n\\n{% image \\\"./rename-css.png\\\", \\\"Rename CSS from kebab case to camel case\\\" %}\\n\\nNow we need to update the button component with the class names from the CSS module.\\n\\n```tsx\\nexport const Button = ({\\n  primary = false,\\n  size = \\\"medium\\\",\\n  backgroundColor,\\n  label,\\n  ...props\\n}: ButtonProps) => {\\n  const mode = primary ? styles.buttonPrimary : styles.buttonSecondary;\\n  let sizeClass = styles.buttonMedium;\\n  if (size === \\\"small\\\") {\\n    sizeClass = styles.buttonSmall;\\n  }\\n  if (size === \\\"large\\\") {\\n    sizeClass = styles.buttonLarge;\\n  }\\n\\n  return (\\n    <button\\n      type=\\\"button\\\"\\n      className={[`${styles.button}`, `${sizeClass}`, mode].join(\\\" \\\")}\\n      style={{ backgroundColor }}\\n      {...props}\\n    >\\n      {label}\\n    </button>\\n  );\\n};\\n```\\n\\nIn your browser, you can now view the \\\"Docs\\\" section for the button with its awesome ability to change properties for your component in real-time.

Now let's open up a terminal, install the prettier package\\nand let's make a new file for the prettier config.\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier\\n```\\n\\n`prettierrc.json`\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"tabWidth\\\": 2,\\n  \\\"semi\\\": true,\\n  \\\"singleQuote\\\": false,\\n  \\\"arrowParens\\\": \\\"avoid\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nSo that's `prettierrc.json` and then we add the json config that we want to use.\\n\\nUnder the storybook directory we want to start by opening up the `main.ts` file\\nand then we're going to add some add-ons to it.\\n\\n```ts\\naddons: [\\n '@storybook/addon-links',\\n '@storybook/addon-essentials',\\n '@storybook/addon-onboarding',\\n '@storybook/addon-actions',\\n '@storybook/addon-interactions',\\n '@storybook/addon-themes',\\n],\\n```\\n\\nNext we are going to add the typescript options.\\n\\n```ts\\ntypescript: {\\n reactDocgen: 'react-docgen-typescript',\\n reactDocgenTypescriptOptions: {\\n compilerOptions: {\\n  allowSyntheticDefaultImports: false,\\n  esModuleInterop: false,\\n },\\n shouldExtractLiteralValuesFromEnum: true,\\n shouldRemoveUndefinedFromOptional: true,\\n propFilter: (prop) =>\\n  prop.parent\\n   ? !/node_modules\\\\/(?!@mui)/.test(prop.parent.fileName)\\n   : true,\\n },\\n},\\n```\\n\\nNow these are going to be able to generate the documentation in the storybook\\nfor us.\\n\\nNext we're going to edit the `preview.ts` file and we've got a few items to add.\\n\\nWe have to add the font files and we need to add the material ui theme provider.\\n\\n```ts\\n//import type { Preview } from \\\"@storybook/react\\\"\\nimport \\\"@fontsource/roboto/300.css\\\";\\nimport \\\"@fontsource/roboto/400.css\\\";\\nimport \\\"@fontsource/roboto/500.css\\\";\\nimport \\\"@fontsource/roboto/700.css\\\";\\nimport \\\"@fontsource/material-icons\\\";\\n\\nimport { CssBaseline, ThemeProvider } from \\\"@mui/material\\\";\\nimport { withThemeFromJSXProvider } from \\\"@storybook/addon-themes\\\";\\nimport theme from \\\"../src/theme\\\";\\n//const preview: Preview = {\\n```\\n\\nNow that we've added the decorators and the parameters we need to add the\\ncorresponding modules for that.\\n\\n```ts\\n//export default preview\\n\\nexport const decorators = [\\n  withThemeFromJSXProvider({\\n    themes: {\\n      default: theme,\\n    },\\n    defaultTheme: \\\"default\\\",\\n    Provider: ThemeProvider,\\n    GlobalStyles: CssBaseline,\\n  }),\\n];\\n\\nexport const parameters = {\\n  controls: {\\n    expanded: true,\\n    matchers: {\\n      color: /(background|color)$/i,\\n      date: /Date$/,\\n    },\\n  },\\n};\\n```\\n\\nSo let's install moving material, emotion react and emotion styled.\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled\\n```\\n\\nAfter that we need to install the font, the material icons, there's a font and\\nthe icons themselves.\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm install @fontsource/roboto @fontsource/material-icons @mui/icons-material @storybook/addon-themes\\n```\\n\\nNow let's close that terminal and we're going to add the `theme.ts` file.\\n\\n```ts\\nimport { createTheme } from \\\"@mui/material/styles\\\";\\nimport { blue, purple, red } from \\\"@mui/material/colors\\\";\\n\\nconst theme = createTheme({\\n  palette: {\\n    primary: {\\n      main: purple.A700,\\n    },\\n    secondary: {\\n      main: blue.A200,\\n    },\\n    error: {\\n      main: red.A400,\\n    },\\n  },\\n});\\n\\nexport default theme;\\n```\\n\\nSo this is what we're referencing in that preview.\\n\\nWe're going to reference the styles in the create theme and we're going to\\nreference some colors.\\n\\nAfter that we will reference the palette that we want to use.\\n\\nYou can see there with the primary, secondary and era.\\n\\nAnd under the stories directory we're going to remove the unused file here for\\nthe header and the page.\\n\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"i6dlD+pwxqkQpuJzU7bEimpUXcg6kS+KxBlv8HivyGY=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/custom-components-mui.md_3":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/custom-components-mui.md_3\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/custom-components-mui.md\",\"file_name\":\"custom-components-mui.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\n\\n## Custom Button Component\\n\\nSo now we're going to open the button component file (`Button.tsx`) and we're\\ngoing to clear out the stuff we don't need.\\n\\nNow because we're using the material ui button we actually want to create a new\\nvision of it to customize it.\\n\\nAnd we've also got to add the button base props and the extra properties that we\\nare going to add as an interface there.\\n\\nSo we've added a label.\\n\\nAfter that we've then added the button component itself and we've added some\\ndefault properties.\\n\\nNow let's open up the `Button.stories.tsx` file.\\n\\nAnd we're going to remove the default content.\\n\\nFirst of all we're going to add the meta properties and that's for the type of\\nthe button.\\n\\nGitHub Source - Button.tsx\\n\\nAnd we're going to create a story object which we're going to add some options\\nto for its arguments.\\n\\nSo in this one we've got color primary and label primary button.\\n\\nSo let's open up a terminal.\\n\\nAnd we can run npm run storybook to get it up and running.\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm run storybook\\n```\\n\\nNow because I've got the Vite extension for VS Code I get a little pop-up there\\nand I can preview in an editor in VS Code.\\n\\nSo let's look at our button in storybook and you can see there we've got the\\ndocuments for it.\\n\\nSo this has got all the previous properties that are coming from mui and we can\\nchange them by the controls there.\\n\\nYou can see we've got a label so we can change that and we should be able to see\\nthe changes reflected.\\n\\nWe can also change the size and the variant for the button.\\n\\nSo now let's open up the button file so you can do command P for that or control\\nP on Windows.\\n\\nNow one of the easiest ways to update the styling of this button is to come in\\nand update the theme.\\n\\nSo if we change the primary color to green here we can open up storybook and see\\nit's reflected here.\\n\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"ATs6QOkKrAaqjHHw2R7oePVkTEba9p5/jQyYGCF+ta4=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/custom-components-mui.md_4":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/custom-components-mui.md_4\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/custom-components-mui.md\",\"file_name\":\"custom-components-mui.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\n\\n## Custom Dropdown Component\\n\\nNow let's look at the file explorer and we're going to create a new component.\\n\\nNow we're going to call this one [drop down].\\n\\nGitHub Source - Dropdown.tsx\\n\\nSo again we extend the existing component from mui and in this case the select.\\n\\nWe then create a type for its base properties.\\n\\nAnd then we create a interface.\\n\\nNext we can add the drop down component and then we can add our default\\nproperties for this component.\\n\\nWe can add the story file now then it's going to be called\\n`Dropdown.stories.tsx`.\\n\\nSo just like the button story we have to add the meta story object and the drop\\ndown component itself to the file.\\n\\nGitHub Source - Dropdown.stories.tsx\\n\\nWe need to create the meta object and do its export and its type of story.\\n\\nNow we're going to add the example for the story there.\\n\\nWe want to import the mui menu item component which we're going to use in our\\nexample.\\n\\nNow that we've imported the menu items, we now need to create an array of the\\nchildren items that are going to be of our drop down.\\n\\nSo the options that people can select.\\n\\nNow we can add the children as arguments to the example.\\n\\nNow that we've added the child items to the example, let's go over some ways\\nthat we can actually do some customization of the actual component itself in\\nterms of its look and feel.\\n\\nSo we can add a star attribute and just like how we would with CSS, we actually\\nhave access to all the standard CSS options available.\\n\\nSo in this case I am setting the background to orange.\\n\\nLet's take a look in the storybook so that we can see how it's turned out and\\nyou can see it is orange in the background there.\\n\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"G3loEuHFEBB5b+g+7qrgDWbFCCgfK4fel+aEFz19z1g=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/custom-components-mui.md_5":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/custom-components-mui.md_5\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/custom-components-mui.md\",\"file_name\":\"custom-components-mui.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\n\\n## Custom Datatable Component\\n\\nNow let's create our new component `DataTable.tsx`.\\n\\nGitHub Source - DataTable.tsx\\n\\nNow this one's going to be a bit more customized in the sense that we've got a\\nlot of elements that are going to make up the component.\\n\\nSo this is the data table and in it it will need to import a whole lot of\\ncomponents.\\n\\nAs you can see here there's table, table body, table cell, table container,\\ntable head and table row.\\n\\nNext we'll make an interface for the data for the table and interface for the\\nheader cell.\\n\\nAnd an interface for the table header props made up of the header cells.\\n\\nThe table props come next where we've got the data, the head cell and whether\\nthe table is zebra striped.\\n\\nSo we're going to need a table header component which is going to take the\\nproperties needed for that header row.\\n\\nAnd now for the component itself which is the data table.\\n\\nWe can de-structure the props for the table into the variables we want to use.\\n\\nWe're now going to use the esx prop which is a shortcut used for defining custom\\nstyles that also has access to the theme.\\n\\nSo now I've made a SX variable and if the property for zebra striped is true\\nthen it's going to set the background color to the gray that's available from\\nmui.\\n\\nWe're going to add the table container, table header etc and to the table row\\ncomponent we're going to add the sx object to the sx props.\\n\\nSo that's going to allow us to customize the table row to show the zebra\\nstriping if it has been set to true.\\n\\nWe now need to make a data table stories file `DataTable.stories.tsx`.\\n\\nGitHub Source - DataTable.stories.tsx\\n\\nAnd like previously we need to import the component and we also need to create a\\nutilities file.\\n\\nWe're going to create our data on top of that.\\n\\nAs usual we need to pull in the meta and the story object.\\n\\nAnd then we need to set these meta so that it gets all the properties.\\n\\nNow of course we need to export that, create the story.\\n\\nWe need to make a set of data for the headers.\\n\\nWe're going to make a function now to help create data and our story\\n`DataTableUtils.tsx`.\\n\\n```tsx\\nimport { Data } from \\\"./DataTable\\\";\\n\\nexport function createData(\\n  id: number,\\n  movieName: string,\\n  director: string,\\n  year: number,\\n  rating: number\\n): Data {\\n  return { id, movieName, director, year, rating };\\n}\\n```\\n\\nSo now we're going to create our data using the utility function create data.\\n\\nNow we can add the example for our story and we're going to pass the rows data\\nin there as you can see and the header cells.\\n\\nWe're now going to make a zebra striped example.\\n\\nLooking back in the browser we're going to look at the data table and you can\\nsee the docs have all rendered there and we've got an example here.\\n\\nOn the following one we have the zebra stripes because we have the zebra striped\\nvalue set to true.\\n\\nSo you can see in the example here I have put a minimum width of 300 pixels and\\nwhen we try to close it to that size it stays at that minimum width.\\n\\nIt's common with responsive design that you want to have different breakpoints\\nand show different sizes so you can do this with the esx prop by using the\\narray.\\n\\nSo in the first example here the breakpoint is for the larger size and it's set\\nto be the 750 pixel mark.\\n\\nNow if we make the viewport smaller we can see that the minimum width switches\\ndown to the 300.\\n\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"sgflLdYTNlbm09s1RSTgtXLO6TPu7jBCA3K/CjH3sOc=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/custom-components-mui.md_6":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/custom-components-mui.md_6\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/custom-components-mui.md\",\"file_name\":\"custom-components-mui.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nSo we've built a storybook now with three custom components.\\n\\nWe've got the button here and we use the theme there to set that primary color.\\n\\nRemember that you can change the

This provides a consistent development environment between machines by launching the project within its dedicated container in VS Code. The live demo showcased common workflows like debugging, installing extensions, and using codespaces for cloud-based container development.\\n\\nVS Code Extension\\n\\nDev Containers Documentation\\n\\nThe following is a transcript of my live stream on YouTube Sep 11, 2023 on Dev Containers in VS Code. This transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\\n\\nyoutube.com/embed/yiJ2lWrVCgk?si=gRRnvuHwD-8cHg8D\\n\\n---\\n\\nHey, it's Andrew here.\\n\\nSo today I'm going to go over developing with dev containers.\\n\\nSo for those that don't know me, I've been a teacher for about two years in software development and I just thought I'd like to share some more knowledge while I can.\\n\\nWell I've got some free time anyway.\\n\\nOkay what are dev containers?\\n\\nSo a dev container is a pre-configured development environment that is packaged up as a container image.\\n\\nThis image includes all of the tools and dependencies that are needed to develop a particular application.\\n\\nThese dev containers can be used to create a consistent development experience for developers, regardless of their operating system or machine configuration.\\n\\nSo Mac, Linux, Windows.\\n\\nThey can also be used to improve the productivity of developers by providing them with a ready-to-use environment that does not require any setup or configuration.\\n\\nSo these dev containers are typically created using a tool like Docker and VS Code.\\n\\nAnd Docker provides a way to create and manage container images.\\n\\nAnd to create the dev container, you first need to create a devcontainer JSON file.\\n\\nThis file specifies the contents of the container image.\\n\\nThe devcontainer json file can be used to install tools, dependencies, and configure the environment.\\n\\nSo a big part of software development is dependencies and managing your environment.\\n\\nSo this can take care of that for you.\\n\\nWhy would you want to use devcontainers?\\n\\nDevkit containers can be a valuable tool for improving the development experience.\\n\\nThey can help to create a consistent development environment, improve productivity and reduce the risk of errors.\\n\\nThat's all stuff we want to do.\\n\\nAs we develop things, okay, so consistency.\\n\\nThat's a big one.\\n\\nConsistent development experience.\\n\\nOkay, so dev containers can help to create a consistent development experience for developers regardless of their operating system or machine configuration. So this can help to improve productivity and reduce the risk of errors. So stopping that tool works on my machine, but doesn't work on yours that kind of thing the improved productivity is is dev containers can help to improve the productivity by providing developers with a ready-to-use environment that does not require any setup or configuration.\\n\\nWe love that, don't we?\\n\\nBeing able to just get started without having to battle through a config.\\n\\nSo that can save a whole little time and frustration.\\n\\nReduce risk of errors.\\n\\nSo dev containers can help to reduce the risk of errors by isolating the development environment from the production environment.\\n\\nThis can help to prevent errors from being introduced in the production environment.\\n\\nHey people, integrated with VS Code, but development experience is much nicer than working with Docker containers alone.\\n\\nSo one cool thing is with VS Code and the containers is that the terminal can actually be looking at the container itself, which is pretty awesome.\\n\\nSo it's a UI one there.\\n\\nAnother real benefit of it is the ability to run in Codespaces.\\n\\nWhat are Codespaces, you're probably asking?\\n\\nSo it's basically a thing that GitHub has, where you can run one of these dev containers on a machine in the cloud.\\n\\nAnd you can do all your development.\\n\\nYou can even share it with other developers.\\n\\nYou can show off what you're working on.\\n\\nAnd it's all pretty much just a quick way of sharing what you're currently working on.\\n\\nMaybe you've got some really big requirements.\\n\\nMaybe you're working on a low spec machine and you need something with a lot of RAM.\\n\\nWith the dev containers there, you could specify that machine to have a whole lot of RAM, and then you'd be able to use that in the cloud.\\n\\nNow you can use that in VS Code, or you can even use it in a browser, which is pretty cool.\\n\\nOkay, the other cool thing with Dev Containers is that it's easy swapping between projects with different dependencies.\\n\\nSay you had a project that was using Node.js 16 and this new one needed 20.\\n\\nBy running the containers, neither version will be installed on your local file system.\\n\\nInstead, it's going to be sitting in those containers and it's going to keep your computer craft free, which is really handy.\\n\\nAs you can imagine, every time that you'd want to have to switch between to node 16 and 20, you'd have to use some other tool to do that.\\n\\nAnd the same thing could be had between, say, different versions of Python or .NET Core for starters.\\n\\nAnd being able to easily switch between them just by running up a container means we don't have to worry about what's installed on your machine.\\n\\nOkay so if you're looking away to improve the development experience, Dev Containers are a great option and they can help to create that consistent development environment that will improve productivity and reduce the risk of errors.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nA few friendly faces that I can see in the chat there, hi everyone.\\n\\nOkay, so let's get into, let's look at the docs.\\n\\nThat's what I always like to do before I get started with anything.\\n\\nLet's jump to code.visualstudio.com.\\n\\nOkay, so this code website, it's got some really great content here what are dev containers and what they're all about etc.\\n\\nProbably the big one to look at is this image here and this might help sort of cement this visual model of what is actually happening.\\n\\nOkay so on the left you've got the local operating system and inside that you've got the VS code, you've got the theme, your UI, your extensions, blah blah blah.\\n\\nBut you've also got the source code.\\n\\nOkay so that's all sitting on your local machine.\\n\\nSo you've pulled down, cloned down a repo down to your machine and you've now got that source code there.\\n\\nYou've got the vs code, pretty much the same as what you're used to.\\n\\nIt's pretty normal.\\n\\nBut when you have a devcontainer.json file, one of the things that the yes code will do is it will pop up a little pop up saying \\\"Would you like to open this in a container?\\\"\\n\\nAnd when it does that, so what just like as you would if you typed docker from the client line or docker compose with a docker file, that would then pull down those image, set that up locally on your machine and then make it available to work on.\\n\\nOkay so what does it do?\\n\\nYou can see there on the right in the container you've got this VS Code server.\\n\\nSo what it actually does is it actually runs VS Code the server which is another open source project, runs that locally in that container, it mounts the source code that's sitting on your machine and then with that container there you've got the file system, you've got the terminal process, you've got the running application debugger, all those are accessible from the VS Code server and VS Code opens that port and can read that VS Code server there and so it's just literally imaging what is in that same container.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nOkay so let's actually let's go through set up a small project and we'll add a dev container to it and so you can see how it actually works.\\n\\nOkay let's get started with that.\\n\\nSo we're going to jump to Visual Studio Code here.\\n\\nSo I've got that open.\\n\\nPre-work visits you're going to need Docker.\\n\\nSee I've got Docker up in here, I've got the dashboard running.\\n\\nAt this point I've got no containers there.\\n\\nThe other thing that you are going to need is this extension here, which is dev containers.\\n\\nI'm going to copy that, paste that into the chat for those that want to have a look.\\n\\nHang on, I'll get the right link here.\\n\\nSo this is the extension ID here.\\n\\nIf you do search for that in your own VS code, that should come up with the right one.\\n\\nAnd you're going to need to install it of course.\\n\\nIt's got a few other prerequisites and it will sort itself out for you.\\n\\nOkay so once that's installed you've got Docker installed up and running, you've got your VS Code, let's make a project.\\n\\nSo you'd either clone something or start fresh like I'm doing right now.\\n\\nI'm just going to clear that.\\n\\nOkay so I'm going to use Next we use the create next app to start building a little project that we're going to add, make it a dev container.\\n\\nOkay so NPX, maybe something I've prepared earlier, there we go, create next app at latest.\\n\\nSo it's going to use the latest version there of next.\\n\\nHit enter, cool okay, my mixed dev container there we go, the name for the project.\\n\\nWe're not going to use TypeScript, I am going to use eslint, we'll use Tailwind, fix the source directory, add router and we're not going to customize the import there.\\n\\nOkay probably seen this before if you've used next.\\n\\nGreat way to get started with a project.\\n\\nIt sets all your templates up for you.\\n\\nYou can see there it's installing all those.\\n\\nAwesome.\\n\\nOkay so now we've got a project sitting under there.\\n\\nMy next dev container.\\n\\nSo I'm going to start.\\n\\nAnd there.\\n\\nAnd I'll start going up from the command line there.\\n\\nAll right.\\n\\nZoom in a little bit.\\n\\nMake it easier to read.\\n\\nHow are we looking?\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nNormal sort of node project, JavaScript project.\\n\\nIf we open it up, okay, so we've got some layout files, page etc.\\n\\nPretty much standard what we've been always used to.\\n\\nNot really any different than say create, react, app etc.\\n\\nAll right.\\n\\nOkay so I've got the my next dev container set up there and what I want to do is I want to make this project now startup under a dev container.\\n\\nNow I've got that extension installed already.\\n\\nSo I do command + shift + P or control + shift + P if you're on a Windows machine.\\n\\nIf you go into the command prompt here and well, funnily enough, it's the top of my list here because it's recently been used.\\n\\nDev containers add dev container configuration files.\\n\\nOkay, when I add that it gives me a whole lot of options.\\n\\nThere's pretty much every single sort of image you can think of.\\n\\nYou know, you can use standard Alpine, Debian, got some node ones and what we're gonna do is I'm gonna choose this one so this is a node.js and a PostgreSQL container.\\n\\nOkay I'm gonna add that I'm just gonna use the default there of 20 and what I can also do is I can actually install a whole lot of other features.\\n\\nSo why would you want to do this?\\n\\nYou can see at the top there there's one password CLI.\\n\\nSo that's a if you use 1 password you can use that to you know do your logins etc.\\n\\nYou can do it all straight from the terminal inside the container.\\n\\nAnd of course you've got plenty of other options here.\\n\\nAnaconda and people doing some builds or something.\\n\\nApp packages, maybe you want to update the container.\\n\\nEven Astro CLI.\\n\\nYeah there's quite a few options there.\\n\\nAre those default options actually?\\n\\nLet's do all.\\n\\nI can find it.\\n\\nThe common.\\n\\nI probably won't have to select it because it's already, yeah it's already part of it I believe.\\n\\nBut the common utilities case things like OhMyZSH and a few other nice little to haves.\\n\\nI'm gonna add it, it's not gonna hurt.\\n\\nOkay and I'm gonna click OK there.\\n\\nThe defaults will be pretty pretty much what you need.\\n\\nWe'll just go through them just to have a quick look but you can see there it's just this configuration of those common there.\\n\\nSo whatever you are adding in terms of software.\\n\\nIt's going to give you some options there.\\n\\nAnd ZSH, we're just going to have a prettier looking shell with OhMyZSH there.\\n\\nOkay, switch to automatic and use automatic and automatic again.\\n\\nOkay, cool.\\n\\nI see previously that VS Code would do a little pop up when it opens a project that's got a dev container and sure enough it's done that little pop up you can see there.\\n\\nSo what we have here we're looking at the dev container json file so this is what's just been added.\\n\\nIt's got a few things pre-configured there it's got the name of it, nodejs + postgressql so that was the container that we selected first up.\\n\\nIt's got for those sort of used docker before you probably would have seen a docker compose file and you can also see there on the right there is a docker file okay so what are we gonna do with the little pop-ups gone we're not gonna panic for starters but we can bring that back up again so if we do Command + Shift + P okay and go dev containers and we can do rebuild or open, okay open the folder in the container, we'll start with that one.\\n\\nIt's uh oh I'm sorry where am I?\\n\\nOpen, rebuild, don't worry, open in container.\\n\\nOkay very quickly, didn't really see that, here we go.\\n\\nIf you click on that quickly while you still have time.\\n\\nIt might be slower for you or faster depending if you've got the images already on your local machine.\\n\\nBut once that's done is what we would normally have to do if we were using just Docker alone, we'd go into the directory, we'd start docker compose, of course it would look at the compose file, start the docker and we'd all be running in that container.\\n\\nOkay, You'll notice one little sort of point of difference when you are running under a container there.\\n\\nYou can see down in the bottom left here, okay, so it's saying that we are editing on Dev Container, Nodejs and Postgres SQL.\\n\\nAnd it's basically if you pop that open, you've got a few other options here for things like attaching to the running container, you can configure the container features, all that kind of thing.\\n\\nAnd like I mentioned previously, you can even create a new code space with it.\\n\\nOkay, I'm gonna start a new terminal.\\n\\nOkay, you've noticed anything about my terminal that it looks slightly different.\\n\\nSo when we were in the VS Code previously, I definitely wasn't in a WorkSpaces folder, I was in my developer folder I believe, and I had a YouTube folder where I've created this project.\\n\\nSo what we're actually looking at when we're looking at the terminal right now is what's in the container there.\\n\\nHow do we prove this.\\n\\nSo we can do something like this.\\n\\nWe can see the version there.\\n\\nOkay so it's saying that the node version there is version 20.\\n\\nOkay like when I, if you can cast your mind back you may want to jump back in the video later after we finished.\\n\\nBut you would have seen when I was setting up the devcontainer.json file there was this section there of the version of node for that image and it was version 20.\\n\\nAnd when I selected that, that of course has installed that version.\\n\\nOkay so hopefully a lot of you, some of you may be more seasoned developers remember the pain of trying to support maybe a legacy application.\\n\\nMaybe it's running on an old version of node and you really want to install that but you don't want to have to go through maybe breaking your dev environment for something else that you've got running.\\n\\nSo these dev containers are a way for you, maybe you're working on something in node 16, and maybe you're working on another project in node 20.\\n\\nBecause they're all self-contained in these containers, and the whole development experience feels just like you're developing locally, you get a premium experience with the ability to have any dependencies that you need they're sitting in those containers and available to you at minus notice, which is way better than having to change all your whole configuration again.\\n\\nI've got one question in the chat.\\n\\nSo the dev container JSON is used to generate the Docker files or it has other uses as well.\\n\\nSo what does it have?\\n\\nLet's get back to it.\\n\\nOkay, I'll just close the terminal.\\n\\nOkay, OK.\\n\\nIt's got basically, let's just go through each part first.\\n\\nSo first of all, you've got a name so you can rename this to whatever you would like.\\n\\nYou've got the docker compose file so it's actually created a docker compose file there in this directory.\\n\\nWe'll have a look at that in a sec.\\n\\nAnd you've got a docker file.\\n\\nFor those that maybe you've looked at a Docker compose or Docker file before and then we have a service and a service has the name.\\n\\nSo this is actually linking to that app straight out of the box.\\n\\nWe've not had to set that all up for us and again the WorkSpaces folder again has been pre-configured for us again using that base folder name.\\n\\nSo when we were looking at that previously in the terminal we could see, was it my dev container.\\n\\nOkay, also this dev container has things like the features there, so we've got all the features configuration there for zsh.\\n\\nAnd not only that, you can also set up, which is probably what a lot of people would like, is things like port forwarding.\\n\\nSo you got the port 3000, which is the standard port for Next.js and we've also got the standard port there for Postgres.\\n\\nOkay so that's going to make the container have those ports open to us so that we're going to be able to use other tools to be able to view things like things like browser and I'm going show you it's sort of using a RMS tool to be able to connect to a database.\\n\\nSo again we've got all that set up and we've got the ports.\\n\\nOne other thing that we can do which again making this whole developer experience much more smoother.\\n\\nWhat's normally the first thing you do when you have a no project when you want to get started.\\n\\nThat is that you're going to have to install an A module, don't you?\\n\\nAnd so one way to automate that whole process is we do actually have the ability to have this post create command.\\n\\nSo once the container has all been created, we can use this post create command to then fire off the, in our case I'm going to use npm, install here and then I don't have to go through the hassle there of going to actually happen to menu and do it.\\n\\nI know, the stress, the pain.\\n\\nIt's all going to be taken care of for me.\\n\\nYou can see there because I changed it the rebuild came out.\\n\\nI click on that again, that's going to again read that dev container file.\\n\\nAgain take that image, it's probably not going to have to do too much apart from install the npm modules here.\\n\\nYou can see that's installing all the node elements there.\\n\\nOkay, so that's done.\\n\\nLike I said before, we are running on the node 20 here.\\n\\nJust to prove that, I'm going to show you my terminal.\\n\\nOh, it's saying there.\\n\\nYou can see here I'm running 18.\\n\\nOkay, so the cool thing about this, this is all self-contained.\\n\\nYou know, you could take this whole setup now, I can event this to say the GitHub and give it to my fellow workmate.\\n\\nThey would be able to clone it down as long as they've got Docker and they've got the dev containers extension.\\n\\nWhen they fire it up and they load up their VS Code, it'll ask them, do they want to open this in a container, which I hope they do, they'll open in a container and it will go through this whole process, everything will be set up for them, the version of node, all the npm modules, all ready to go.\\n\\nAnd all that they're going to have to do is do something like this.\\n\\nCome into npm scripts, or no different than actually running it from here, so I'll we'll do it from the terminal just to show.\\n\\nSo npm run dev.\\n\\nSo that's starting up.\\n\\nSo I now switch back to Chrome.\\n\\nI open my localhost, all right so now I've got just the standard sort of loading page for nextjs there.\\n\\nIt's running from a container, the ports are being forwarded, so I know that the ports here being redirected you can see there I've got that Localize 3000.\\n\\nLet's also have a look at what is happening on the Docker site.\\n\\nOkay looks familiar we've got our project name and inside it we've got two containers.\\n\\nSo one container is a database and the other is the app.\\n\\nOkay so one is running the next app and the other one is running Postgres in there.\\n\\nSo this database of course is empty but I would be able to connect to it say from something like I've got bee keeper studio open here.\\n\\nIf I connect to that, I believe it's Postgres of the password by default, I connect to that.\\n\\nEmpty database, awesome.\\n\\nSo of course, you know, whole empty environment's all ready to rock in just a few seconds.\\n\\nIf you're using the same sort of container images of course on lots of different projects, you know speed's going to vary, but generally it's not too slow.\\n\\nAnd the cool thing is that even the database is contained.\\n\\nSo in this case, just trying to remember what's the Postgres version.\\n\\nWe can find out actually, we can go to the Docker files probably in here.\\n\\nDocker compose.\\n\\nSo let's just get him the latest version of Postgres there.\\n\\nSo again, this shouldn't be anything different to anyone that's used Docker before.\\n\\nYou've probably seen images etc.\\n\\nSo if we went to Docker Hub and we looked for that.\\n\\nTalk to you in the lab.\\n\\nWait, no hands?\\n\\nHmm, I didn't let that run.\\n\\nI'm not sure what's going on, but whatever the latest version of PostScript there, it's setting up that one.\\n\\nSo again, like I was talking before about any project is going to have some dependencies of some sort.\\n\\nThere may be something that you can't upgrade straight away.\\n\\nIt's going to require a whole lot of refactoring.\\n\\nSo because the dev containers are all self-contained, we could use an older version and not have to worry about an effecting our local machine.\\n\\nLet's go back to VS Code there.\\n\\nAlright.\\n\\nOkay, let's just have a quick walk through this compose file.\\n\\nAgain, like I said, very much the same.\\n\\nIt's got the services as you normally would have.\\n\\nIt's got the app and it's got the bb.\\n\\nAnd it's got that all ready to rock because you've got the environment variables there and the volume mount all set up ready.\\n\\nSo this project now is actually running in a container.\\n\\nI can refresh, I can do just like as I normally would if I was working on an Next.js project.\\n\\nI can go into the app folder, I can go into the page here.\\n\\nWhat do I do?\\n\\nHello world.\\n\\nOkay save that.\\n\\nAnd sure enough I can't spell, but it's saying hello world.\\n\\nSo you can see there that it's just like you would normally be developing locally.\\n\\nThere's no sort of real noticeable difference to what you were working on.\\n\\nOf course you could set up, you'd have a whole lot of containers running, you could actually have and have multiple running as long as you're not using the same ports.\\n\\nSo it's no different than running locally on your machine.\\n\\nShould I put a frog in there?\\n\\nGood idea Chelsea.\\n\\nOkay, alright.\\n\\nThere's a frog.\\n\\nOh frog time's sakes.\\n\\nOkay so that's there.\\n\\nOf course, got a little emoji there.\\n\\nOkay, this project is of course is, like I said, running in a container.\\n\\nAnd of course if I stop that container then it's going to stop working.\\n\\nSo let's just pause.\\n\\nLet's stop everything actually.\\n\\nStop it.\\n\\nOnce that finishes.\\n\\nStraight away PS code realizes, hey something's gone wrong.\\n\\nlike I was saying before, it's using that first code server so it's requiring that to be running to be able to connect to.\\n\\nOkay so I shouldn't be able to access this anymore.\\n\\nIt's just going to spin the wheel and it's not going to load for a time out.\\n\\nSame for the database.\\n\\nWe've got a question there in the chat.\\n\\nAre containers used in a production environment?\\n\\nYes they can.\\n\\nSo you can get quite complicated setups.\\n\\nMaybe you've already got a project that is already using Docker in your production environment.\\n\\nMaybe you've got a mono repo, maybe with sort of three different, maybe a server, a client, a database.\\n\\nActually let's pull one up.\\n\\nLet's make this actually a bit more interactive.\\n\\nWe'll pull one up rather than just talk about it.\\n\\nSo what have I got here?\\n\\nThis is the project I made a while ago.\\n\\nSo I'll clone this down for my local machine and I'll walk through how it's kind of different to say like a traditional sort of docker setup and something you might be have in production with docker containers.\\n\\nSo I'm going to clone that down.\\n\\nOkay so let's set the term.\\n\\nLet's set folder, type in code.\\n\\nAll right okay it's got a workspace file it doesn't really make too much difference there um but we can see there uh it's got just the three different folders so the client see the database um and the root there which is the top level so this is a workspace file I don't know if you've used that before but um it just makes it a little bit easier to separate out all the three different parts of a mono repo.\\n\\nOkay, so this client, we have a docker file for your client, we have a docker file for the server, it's running a sort of pin sort of stack, so postgres, express, react, and node, and if we go down to here we can see we have a docker compose file.\\n\\nOkay so I can start this up just as I would normally.\\n\\nI can go docker-compose up and get that actual project up and running in a container which is perfectly fine.\\n\\nThat's a that's a great way to to work and I probably wouldn't use a dev container as such if I had a project like this but we can.\\n\\nSo we're going to show you how you can do that if you want to.\\n\\nSo the easiest way to probably do that is we'll just close this.\\n\\nWe're going to jump back into the terminal here and I'm going to use docker compose up and build.\\n\\nOkay so it's got a database there.\\n\\nSetting up a little configuration.\\n\\nJust waiting on the client.\\n\\nOkay, pretty typical.\\n\\nSo in a production environment, of course, you're going to want to have sort of like a container like this.\\n\\nThe good thing about it is you'd be able to, you know, set up a different container for each of the different parts of the the application.\\n\\nIt should be sitting on their own version and of course you know if you were setting up something really big and chunky you'd probably use some sort of container management and you may end up having maybe two versions of the API and two versions of the client or something like that just for in terms of ability to handle larger loads maybe.\\n\\nBut that's not really what we need on our local setup and so sometimes we may want to actually see what is actually happening on a container.\\n\\nSo we've got a long-running process that maybe is timing out and say node or something like that and we can actually attach to that container with a whole dev container configuration setup.\\n\\nSo let's do that.\\n\\nI'm gonna create a new one, window, command + shift + P and I'm gonna attach to a running container.\\n\\nSo cool enough, it just shows straight away we've got those three running containers, we've got the client, we've got the server the database.\\n\\nSo I can just jump straight into say the server here.\\n\\nOkay, so sets up the VS Code server.\\n\\nOkay, give it a sec.\\n\\nOkay, it's having a little bit of trouble there looking at the directory, that's okay.\\n\\nWhat I can do is I can open the folder and actually attach to it.\\n\\nAnd that should be, that looks like the right one.\\n\\nSo it's attached to that.\\n\\nIt's running under the dev container there.\\n\\nI can do this and I have 10 I can see what I'm actually running under there.\\n\\nYou can see I've got a very basic looking terminal here.\\n\\nThere's obviously no my zsh or anything like that.\\n\\nSo it's not getting the pretty colors or anything but it's a very basic sort of. So this container is available there and a common thing that you're going to want to do is try and I guess do some debugging.\\n\\nOk so we've got the router here and in it we've got a get request.\\n\\nI'm going to put a breakpoint in there and I'm now going to load up the project again.\\n\\nHow do I know where the project's running?\\n\\nWell, I'm going to have to step back and have a look at the actual files.\\n\\nMaybe open up a new window.\\n\\nOpen that recent one.\\n\\nAnd in here we've got Dockerfile.\\n\\nSo okay our project here runs on port 3000.\\n\\nSo I'm going to Again, just take a look.\\n\\nHopefully that'll run.\\n\\nHere we go, took a little while.\\n\\nBut you can see we've got a sort of website with some dogs wearing sunglasses, hats etc.\\n\\nSo it's just like a little shop that you'd be able to purchase clothes for your dog.\\n\\nOkay so that's that project there.\\n\\nWhat we can do is that we can actually try and get this to be able to debug.\\n\\nSo we have the docker and we can attach the node there.\\n\\nOK, let's see if this works.\\n\\nI didn't preset this up so it works, it works, it doesn't!\\n\\nIt's a fail.\\n\\nIt doesn't look like it's actually working.\\n\\nNope, no I was wrong.\\n\\nIt has, it's attached.\\n\\nTook a while there.\\n\\nBut you can see there when we have done the get request and what it's done is it's read my breakpoint there.\\n\\nis sitting in this container and I've been able to connect to it.\\n\\nI can see if there's any parameters being passed in.\\n\\nSo request our query there.\\n\\nWe've got direction and sort order and we can step through which is pretty cool.\\n\\nSo that way we can actually debug our running a whole item just as if it was sitting on a local machine from the Docker containers themselves.\\n\\nSo you can also set up these dev containers here, so you can actually set up this project now to use the dev containers.json file as well.\\n\\nWhy you'd probably want to do that is if you had some extra requirements, those could be something like you want a command line tool to be available only in dev but not on production.\\n\\nWhat you can do is you can set up the dev container file, attach it to the Docker file and because the dev container runs as before it when you're running in a development environment, you can make it install those feel-like tools but only in dev.\\n\\nOK and then use the existing Dockerfile for when it's actually creating container for production.\\n\\nPretty nice.\\n\\nOK we've sort of got the debugger working.\\n\\nI'm just going to make that run.\\n\\nOkay, so my zooming, zooming.\\n\\nI do have a load of there, it's just a little bit hard to see.\\n\\nI should probably remove my breakpoint.\\n\\nOkay, cool.\\n\\nAlright, so that's all working totally.\\n\\nSo like I said, let's close this and move the connection there and we'll go back to the file system.\\n\\nOkay, so I'm attached to this container and say I want, like I said, I wanted to make the the container there.\\n\\nDev containers.\\n\\nAnd you can see there's a lot of choices here.\\n\\nBecause I'm already running it as one.\\n\\nI have to actually close, go back to the previous window.\\n\\nThere's this one.\\n\\nAnd I can add a dev container.\\n\\nSo this is no different than pretty much what we were before in the first Next.js project.\\n\\nAnd you can use one of the predefined configurations that we were happy for.\\n\\nOr we can use the existing docker-compose file.\\n\\nSo this project is the designer of the doggies is one and that's got the docker-compose file there.\\n\\nSo if I select it, Okay, now there is one problem with dev containers is that they only can be one window per application.\\n\\nSo in this case I would need two configured, one maybe for the client and one for the server.\\n\\nI'm just going to do the client for now.\\n\\nAnd I wanted these common utilities because I I want a bit of a bit of flair on my terminal.\\n\\nOK, so we've got the defaults there.\\n\\nLet's keep those.\\n\\nSo again, I can reopen in the container.\\n\\nLet's wait for that to load.\\n\\nDoesn't matter if you're late.\\n\\ncourse you can come back and watch it again.\\n\\nWhat have I done?\\n\\nOne window.\\n\\nGood question.\\n\\nWhy have I not tried Twitch?\\n\\nI just haven't tried it yet.\\n\\nThis is my first go so I'm trying out YouTube for starters but I was aware I've got all my previous videos and I'll probably take this stream as well and also might package it up in a blog post too.\\n\\nAlright, okay so what happened there?\\n\\nI think I had a little bit of an issue.\\n\\nThat's okay.\\n\\nLet's use our problem solving skills and try and figure out what has actually happened.\\n\\nWait a minute, Windows open.\\n\\nLoad the window.\\n\\nThat's the previous one.\\n\\nOkay, what did I do wrong?\\n\\nOkay, we wanted the client.\\n\\nI don't see it there.\\n\\nI find the.\\n\\n.\\n\\n.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo we've got the demo designer doggies.\\n\\nI'm going to open up this client folder.\\n\\nYep, that's all cool.\\n\\nOkay, I might have to do that again.\\n\\nI believe the problem I had was because I was in the top level and I actually need to be like I said can only be one window.\\n\\nSo I actually needed to have that configuration file.\\n\\nI needed to have it in the actual client folder.\\n\\nSo I wanted to try that again.\\n\\nSo I can go from the Dockerfile.\\n\\nAdd these common utilities, defaults there and I should be able to reopen it in a container.\\n\\nI just waiting for it to do the install.\\n\\nAbsolutely now, it does feel like the old days.\\n\\nfor the audience.\\n\\nIt was actually Macavari there.\\n\\nWhat do people prefer?\\n\\nWould you rather me just keep on YouTube or Twitch or both?\\n\\nBecause I guess that's an option too isn't Totally open the suggestions.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nGo.\\n\\nOkay cool.\\n\\nLike I said, you're a container now.\\n\\nyou've got the likes of it pointing to the existing Dockerfile.\\n\\nAnd you can see there, it's got the Dockerfile, it's pointing to this one here, and we've now got the common utilities.\\n\\nSo if I create a new terminal here, I don't know if it's actually created the right console there, but you can see there I've got just the git just like I would normally sitting and running in this container and I can see the files are there and check them in.\\n\\ncool.\\n\\nAlright.\\n\\nYes I could have the best of both worlds Blender.\\n\\nYeah that might be I think the winner.\\n\\nBe where everyone is.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nI have a cut with everything pretty much I think.\\n\\nSo the main key things that you are going to want to configure with your dev containers there again is the porting the ports.\\n\\nSo you can do it through the user interface.\\n\\nSo you are actually able to port a port, send the port number etc.\\n\\nAnd that will work fine.\\n\\nBut I'd recommend you do it in the configuration file because of course you want it to be able to work for I guess your other teammates or other developers they want to be able to just get started and get the application running and that will be a bit of a roadblocker there if the ports aren't folded and they won't be able to sort of view the I guess the database or the API etc so you need those ports open best to keep that configuration in that dev container file and of course that's not going to impact your docker file, so if the project is already running in production etc it's just sort of sitting separate to it.\\n\\nThe other cool thing with dev containers is that you can actually install extensions for a container.\\n\\nYou know when I was going at the start where we were talking about the actual on the left was the browser page on the left you've got the VS code there you know with the extensions etc and a key thing there you've got a workspace extension so the cool thing is so if the project is you know where it's gonna need some of these extensions you can actually configure it to be set up so that when someone else comes along to start the project up they can have those extensions already ready to go installed on their machine as well.\\n\\nSo let's do that.\\n\\nPeople can see that.\\n\\nOkay so you got no no containers on there as such.\\n\\nSo say if I wanted to have I don't know what's something good.\\n\\nA spellcheeker.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nNo, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.\\n\\nLook at the icons they tell you.\\n\\nSee?\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nWhat's something else?\\n\\nDocker?\\n\\nsomething that's actually probably, either the normal one would be maybe prettier.\\n\\nThat's a pretty common one.\\n\\nSo I can install in that dev container there.\\n\\nAnd so then your project would then have that listed.\\n\\nSo if we see that, that's sort of locally installed.\\n\\nAnd now I've got this dev container here.\\n\\nGreat for when you want to get some started with running up on a project and have all those extensions there they're going to help them with their development.\\n\\nCool cool lots of comments here.\\n\\nUh Yeah absolutely, just get more of a stream when you're working on a project you're just chilling.\\n\\nThat's a great idea.\\n\\nYeah I could do a bit of a mix of both.\\n\\nCode was yeah, working on doing our projects to game dev.\\n\\nCool, I guess different flavors for different things that you're doing.\\n\\nCool, okay so like I said you can install these extensions and they're now going to be, once you check that devcontainer.\\n\\njson file in, that of course is then going to be able to be pulled down by somebody else and you'd be able to have all those things like all your extensions there.\\n\\nI'll show you there in the dev container file.\\n\\nWe should have the extensions.\\n\\nUse it.\\n\\nMaybe it's Docker.\\n\\nMaybe it's because I already had it installed.\\n\\nBut generally you'd have it in that dev containers there and it would sit under there.\\n\\nespecially under the customizations.\\n\\nOkay, another thing again going back over again was the post command, post create command.\\n\\nIt's like I said you could have that install all your npm modules.\\n\\nAgain, nice developer experience, you're not having to go to the project and of course, I'm happy to do the Impairments Store, you can have it already at rock.\\n\\nWhat else can you have?\\n\\nLet's do one other thing.\\n\\nClose all these down so that you can see.\\n\\nWhat's running?\\n\\nstop button.\\n\\nI'm sure it will stop.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nOf course, when you stop VS Code, that's also going to stop those containers as well, which is quite nice actually.\\n\\nIt means that you're not burning resources or killing your battery if you're on a laptop.\\n\\nOkay, so I wanted to show you code spaces because that's also really cool in that you can actually go through and of course be developing on another machine.\\n\\nOkay so code.\\n\\nI'm going to open up that first project we had.\\n\\nOkay, so I'll reopen this container.\\n\\nOkay, that's better than me, it didn't work.\\n\\nHow's that?\\n\\nThat's good.\\n\\nOK, so I'll reopen this container.\\n\\nOK, that's better, the mute didn't work.\\n\\nHow's that?\\n\\nThat's better.\\n\\nOK, cool.\\n\\nOK.\\n\\nOK, so I've got this project.\\n\\nIt's sitting in my local machine and like I said I can open this in a code space.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nIt must be somewhere, you're running it.\\n\\nAh here we go, I had to find an actual option.\\n\\nOk so we've got this, click on the button down the bottom left here, let's do it again.\\n\\nClick on the button down the bottom left and you can create a new codespace.\\n\\nSo this is going to set that up on.\\n\\nNow you do have to have a previously set up project.\\n\\nI'll use the demo designer doggies.\\n\\nThat's already publicly available.\\n\\nAnd you've got a choice there.\\n\\nAh, AdGigs.\\n\\nWe'll try that one.\\n\\nthis is very much that same sort of experience where we're still in VS Code.\\n\\nBut we are now actually again talking to a container that's sitting on some machine in the cloud which is pretty awesome.\\n\\nOkay, it's got a funny name, improved in England.\\n\\nOkay so that container is like running up in the cloud there.\\n\\nIf I go to that same might get up.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nJust trying to remember where the code space is, let it hit them.\\n\\nThere we go.\\n\\nSo over here.\\n\\nSo the cool thing about it, like I said before, is you can actually run this in a browser.\\n\\nI'm trying to open it in the browser, it's not leading me.\\n\\nThere we go, open them.\\n\\nSo you get your open browser.\\n\\nAnd they should look very familiar.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nSo again, we've got a whole development environment.\\n\\nI mean, you could potentially use this on an iPad or some other device, maybe a Chromebook something like that you'd be able to do your development there, check it in, commit it, make it available to others to see.\\n\\nSo let's see, you got the whole configuring up of that of course and port forwarding etc but yeah we can run this whole application sitting in the cloud here.\\n\\nI've got a nice little client here, I've got some, you can see my username there, you can see that's running in that browser.\\n\\nAgain, lots of potential there to do all sorts of things.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nQuestions?\\n\\nDoes anyone have any questions?\\n\\nNo, hopefully I've done a good job then.\\n\\nIs there a cost to use this?\\n\\nDefinitely for the Codespaces there is a cost.\\n\\nI think you do get a certain amount of free time.\\n\\nBut can't remember off the top of my head the cost?\\n\\nNo, I'm sorry.\\n\\n180 included hours for Codespace with GitHub Pro.\\n\\nWell, yeah, that's a really great tool.\\n\\nEspecially if you're working on a project, maybe you're working on a branch, you'd be able to spin this up in the code spaces here.\\n\\nAnd then you would actually be able to share that with somebody else.\\n\\nYou know, actually specifically talk through the actual problem and have it running so it's on the cloud there.\\n\\nEasy to view, easy to see.\\n\\nI hope you all enjoyed that.\\n\\nAwesome.\\n\\nAlright, I'll try and do some more of these.\\n\\nA few more topics, but if there's anything that you specifically want to me to go over, I'd be happy to do that as well.\\n\\nArduino?\\n\\nI haven't got any Arduino, sorry.\\n\\nIf you think of anything that you would like me to go over, I would be happy to do another stream.\\n\\nI have a little time on my hand, so let's make the most of it.\\n\\nCatch you all later.\\n\\n{% include

I decided in August to take a side step in to teaching.\\n\\nWhile I had mentored many junior developers over my career this was something new and exciting to me. Getting the chance to impart my knowledge and skills on to a new generation of developers sounded exciting and fresh. Most importantly the job was remote too.\\n\\nStarting the job I had a two week window to get acquainted with what I'd be teaching and immerse myself in the content that had already been created (exercises and projects) before I started teaching.\\n\\nOnce the term started and I was teaching two lessons a day to 25 students online via Google Meet. Teaching them first how to get Git set up on their computers and all the other software needed to start developing. While the first couple of lessons felt quite daunting, after a week I felt completely at ease with the students.\\n\\nI feel in the short time I've been teaching, my understanding of JavaScript and HTML/CSS has improved greatly. Even after using these technologies for **20 years**. When you have to explain how and why things work the way that they do you always want to be prepared for those questions from students. Because I can assure you they are going to ask hard questions. You continually want to keep improving your teaching style and approach too. There are even times you will have to change tact with how you are teaching mid lesson. It definitely keeps you on your toes.\\n\\nThe biggest change I've found in my own well being is the feeling of satisfaction now with what I do in my job. While I did enjoy the developing of software, it's the lack of connection of your work to a customer/user that isn't great with the majority of jobs I've been at in the past. Whereas both during and after classes I receive _comments and feedback directly from my students almost every day_.\\n\\nI've now survived one term teaching Client Side Web Development. The students enjoyed my teaching style and have given me lot's of praise and feedback. More importantly I've enjoyed every week of teaching.\\n\\nIf you feel like you need a change to developing software maybe consider teaching and come join me and the rest of the team at Developers Institute.\\n\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"VowneqPzAWN7EAyDHak6HLGQilMKBVopqk5caSWU0K4=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/lastfm-widget-netlify-functions.md_1":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/lastfm-widget-netlify-functions.md_1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/lastfm-widget-netlify-functions.md\",\"file_name\":\"lastfm-widget-netlify-functions.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"---\\ntitle: Make a LastFM widget for your website using Serverless functions\\ndate: \\\"2023-02-16T04:01:37Z\\\"\\ntemplate: post\\ndraft: false\\nslug: \\\"lastfm-widget-netlify-functions\\\"\\ncategory: article\\ntags:\\n  - netlify\\n  - lastfm\\n  - widget\\n  - serverless\\n  - serverless functions\\ndescription: \\\"Here is the latest transcript of my guide on how to make a LastFM widget using Serverless (Netlify) functions to show the latest track played on your website.\\\"\\n---\\n\\nWould it not be great to share what I'm listening to on my website? I've been using LastFM for years to track my listening habits and I thought it would be great to use their API to do so. The hard part though was my site is \\\"static\\\" built with eleventy (11ty), it's a static site generator which means a build process puts all the files together and turns it into HTML every time I push commits to GitHub. The files are static and can't dynamically change like a Node.js or Wordpress website. So I needed a way to get the data from LastFM and display it on my site. I could have used a JavaScript fetch request to get the data, but that would mean exposing my API key to the world. I needed a way to get the data securely and Netlify (serverless) functions was the answer.\\n\\nHere is the transcript from my latest how-to guide on how to make a LastFM widget for your own website showing your last played song that uses Netlify functions (serverless functions).\\n\\nyoutube.com/embed/okbDFf-eIqk\\n\\n---\\n\\nHi everyone, it's Andrew here and I'm here to show you a new tutorial on how to build a last FM widget on your website.

Serverless functions, also known as Functions As A Service, are a way of building and running computer programs without needing to worry about the underlying servers or infrastructure. Instead, a cloud provider takes care of managing the servers and resources, and developers can just write and deploy their code. Serverless functions are triggered by specific events or requests and can quickly execute and shut down when they're finished. This makes them efficient, cost-effective and flexible, and they're often used for tasks that don't require continuous running or need to handle a lot of traffic.\\n\\nTo be able to make a fetch request, I'm going to add the Node fetch package to my project, so we can make a get request from the Last FM API to get the last played track for my account.\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm install -D node-fetch@3\\n```\\n\\nOnce we have that setup, we can create a JavaScript function to make the get request return the result. I've made my function an imported node fetch, and then made a handler function for my get request. I then pulled in my API key from the environment file that we created, and then you can see here we have a request with the API key added as a string literal. I then created a last track object and retrieved the appropriate details from the JSON data requested and finally returned the result. You can see I have my Last FM username in the string for the URL that we're calling. You will need to replace that with your own username.\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport fetch from \\\"node-fetch\\\";\\n\\nexports.handler = async function (event, context) {\\n  try {\\n    const apiKey = process.env.LASTFM_API_KEY;\\n    const username = \\\"YOUR_USERNAME\\\";\\n    const response = await fetch(\\n      `http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?method=user.getrecenttracks&user=${username}&api_key=${apiKey}&format=json`,\\n      {\\n        method: \\\"GET\\\",\\n      }\\n    );\\n\\n    const data = await response.json();\\n    const lastTrackData = data.recenttracks.track[0];\\n\\n    const lastTrack = {\\n      artist: lastTrackData.artist[\\\"#text\\\"],\\n      trackName: lastTrackData.name,\\n      album: lastTrackData.album[\\\"#text\\\"],\\n      url: lastTrackData.url,\\n      albumArt: lastTrackData.image[1][\\\"#text\\\"],\\n    };\\n\\n    return {\\n      statusCode: 200,\\n      body: JSON.stringify(lastTrack),\\n    };\\n  } catch (error) {\\n    return {\\n      statusCode: 500,\\n      body: JSON.stringify({ error_description: error.message }),\\n    };\\n  }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"m7BQIGiE9hIAIf1ttnac+m4tSfUJ8whfdnro4xixQrM=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/lastfm-widget-netlify-functions.md_5":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/lastfm-widget-netlify-functions.md_5\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/lastfm-widget-netlify-functions.md\",\"file_name\":\"lastfm-widget-netlify-functions.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\n\\n### Fetch Data\\n\\nWe now have a way to retrieve our data from Last FM in a secure way, protecting our API key.

While I have lots of experience in software development, I only have limited teaching experience. This was previously gained on the job mentoring junior developers in the workplace. Of course, being relatively new to teaching, there is much room for personal improvement, especially on the learning theory side. But even though this time frame has been short, my teaching practices have constantly evolved through trial and error. Improved from advice from the rest of the teaching team and, most recently, from taking the DCTL course.\\n\\nThe institute (Developers Institute) I work at has some critical points of difference in how we teach compared to most tertiary education providers. First, the entire school is remote only, learners and teaching teams alike. This heavily impacts our teaching process in all manner of study, teaching and assessment for our learners. We have to lean into digital learning every day. We follow the Community of Inquiry teaching model developed by Garrison, Anderson & Archer[^1] to facilitate this. So that engaged learning occurs, we must have interaction through the three core elements:\\n\\n- Social presence - which I do by using tools like Google Meet or Zoom so that the learners can see and hear their peers and me (we ask the learners to leave their cameras on, which improves social presence). They can ask questions, and we can interact on the call.\\n- Cognitive presence - where to keep the learners engaged, I use digital tools such as Miro for online white-boarding, the screen can be shared on the video calling software, and the link to the board can be directly shared (via a browser) for the class. This can be helpful for the learners to go back and look at the board again after class or during the course to collaborate, letting learners add sticky notes and text etc., to fully engage with what is being taught.\\n- Teaching presence - During a call, I facilitate the class and guide the lesson, ensuring we keep on task. Starting discussion topics, asking guiding questions and offering help if required.\\n\\nThere are a lot of benefits to a digital and collaborative online class environment. One of the biggest for the Developers Institute is equity and accessibility. All our students can access tertiary education no matter where they are located in the country. We provide them with a computer for the entirety of the course. The only other things they need to have are a good internet connection and a quiet place to study. If they have whānau they care for outside of a large centre, they are not disadvantaged. If they have young children to care for, they are not disadvantaged. They interact with learners and a teaching team located all over Aotearoa (New Zealand) with a wide diverse range of learners from all stages of life and cultures.\\n\\nThe most challenging aspect of a digital remote online class environment is ensuring students actively engage in learning and get the required help. While remote, it may seem more challenging to keep an eye on how learners are engaging and progressing in their studies, but in fact, it's quite the opposite these days with the number of available tools we employ. For starters, we can track each learner's progress through their online classroom material in iQualify, and see those needing encouragement or help. View the progress of their exercise via GitHub Classroom, and offer relevant feedback specific to the context of their work. Keep in contact regularly via Slack and Google Meet. We also have a team that can answer their questions via a ticketing system and quickly get the learners the help they need. These tools are necessary to offer the level of support we do.\\n\\nTo further the learning experience, I follow contemporary pedagogies in my teaching process. For example, I have used constructionism in my classes by running \\\"mob programming\\\" lessons where I get the learners to develop a web form using an online integrated development environment or IDE for short. This tool, called Replit allows the learners to collaborate on the same codebase in real time together. It will enable multiple people to work on the same code file simultaneously. In conjunction with a video call, I can facilitate the class and let the learners take turns, discuss and suggest to one another what steps should be taken to build the web form. What I find in my classes in this scenario as learners help one another and discuss the merits of what they have built. The Learners who aren't always vocal engage more in the comfortable, collaborative scenario. The tool works well in an online situation and would also be good in an in-person computer lab situation.\\n\\nIn our final paper, the capstone course, we create a learning environment internal to the Developers Institute and with other partners where we get the learners to work on a project over eight weeks. We use constructivism in this project in the case of the Developers Institute, where it's a collaboration effort with our engineering team and a small group of students. The engineer from the Developers Institute will outline a project brief of more than half the elements the learners already know what to do. But the learners must research and learn about specific portions of the project to complete it. The engineer will be on hand to work with the group to give them the guidance they need when appropriate, but they are free to use new concepts and ideas to achieve the goal of completing the project brief. This uses the idea of Vygotsky’s zone of proximal development[^2], where the learner can do with the guidance of a knowledgeable other, in this case, the engineer from the Developers Institute.\\n\\nWe combine the capstone course with the use of experiential learning theory as well. The learners are asked to complete the project and present their progress and findings with a fortnightly demonstration to staff and stakeholders at the Developers Institute. This is in conjunction with a portfolio assessment where they are asked to reflect on their learning and experience building out the project over the eight weeks.\\n\\nBoth experiential learning and constructivism have some disadvantages, hence why we don't use them until the last project of a capstone, where we are focused on getting the learners to focus on how they can learn new concepts or technologies they haven't used before and how to apply them in context of a software solution. Using them too early in the course would require too much core knowledge and would be totally reliant on the engineer (knowledgeable other) to help build the project. At the end of the course, they have covered all the core knowledge over previous terms and can quite easily make a small web app with authorisation and implement an API with database write and read functionality. Because the groups are relatively small, we can be more confident that all the students will have meaningful experiences concerning experiential learning. Also, with the learning experience happening outside of a traditional classroom setting, we negate constructionism's limitations where the learners can focus on the learning by doing.\\n\\nFinally, sustainability is something that we want to impart to our learners at Developer Institute. Sustainability can cover many things regarding education, but the two areas I'd like to highlight in my teaching practice are sustainable learning and the sustainability of the environment.\\n\\nRegarding education, we wish to make learning sustainable for our learners to succeed in their work lives in the fast-changing world of software development. What was once the current framework of choice this year could be out of favour the next. As our learners will experience many changes throughout their careers, finding relevant information on upcoming technologies is fundamental to being ready for this. This is a challenging task; unfortunately, we suggest recommended sources such as the W3C, the Mozilla developers network and how to find relevant information on programming languages. On top of those resources, it pays to form networking groups of your peers in both school alumni and other thought leaders in their fields, whether by social media, forums, or simply following trending libraries and frameworks on GitHub.\\n\\nThe other aspect of sustainability we wish to encourage in our learners is the sustainability of the environment. One significant part of that is fundamental in how Developers Institute operates as a remote-only school. A high number of our learners, after graduating, look for remote-only jobs as that is how they feel most comfortable working after spending one or two years learning remotely. EECA attest[^3], \\\"Over 50% of New Zealand's energy-related emissions come from transport. Burning fossil fuels like petrol and diesel produces harmful emissions contributing to climate change\\\". If more people worked from home, they would not need to drive to an office, reducing emissions.\\n\\nTeaching software development remotely has been a challenging yet fulfilling experience for me. The use of digital tools and contemporary pedagogies such as constructionism, experiential learning, and constructivism have helped to engage learners and facilitate their learning process. The Developers Institute's focus on equity and accessibility has allowed learners from all stages of life and cultures to access tertiary education anywhere in New Zealand. The institute's emphasis on sustainability in learning and the environment is essential for our learners to succeed in their future careers and contribute to a better world. Teaching software development remotely has been a radical change, but I have found it to be an effective and flexible way of providing education to learners. I wish to learn more additional tools and pedagogies and incorporate them into my teaching practice.\\n\\n[^1]: Garrison, D. R., Anderson, T., & Archer, W. (1999).

In the `pages/api/` folder create a new file `checkout_sessions.js`. Add the following to this file:\\n\\n```js\\nconst stripe = require(\\\"stripe\\\")(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);\\n\\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\\n  if (req.method === \\\"POST\\\") {\\n    try {\\n      // Check priceId has been provided\\n      if (!req.body?.priceId) {\\n        throw new Error(\\\"Price ID not provided\\\");\\n      }\\n      // Create Checkout Sessions from body params.\\n      const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({\\n        line_items: [\\n          {\\n            // Provide the exact Price ID (for example, pr_1234) of the product you want to sell\\n            price: req.body.priceId,\\n            quantity: 1,\\n          },\\n        ],\\n        mode: \\\"payment\\\",\\n        success_url: `${process.env.HOST}/success`,\\n        cancel_url: `${process.env.HOST}/canceled`,\\n      });\\n      res.redirect(303, session.url);\\n    } catch (err) {\\n      res.status(err.statusCode || 500).json(err.message);\\n    }\\n  } else {\\n    res.setHeader(\\\"Allow\\\", \\\"POST\\\");\\n    res.status(405).end(\\\"Method Not Allowed\\\");\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis function will only allow POST requests. It also checks to ensure that the request body contains the price ID for the product, before redirecting to Stripe requesting with our private Stripe key.\\n\\nIn the previous step we have a form with a price ID value that we can post to this new `checkout_sessions.js` API route.\\n\\nOn the product page we need to add the Stripe front-end library which generates a new shopping object. Let's first install via the terminal:\\n\\n```shell\\nnpm install --save @stripe/stripe-js\\n```\\n\\nOnce that's been added we can then add the following to the `index.js` file to create a Stripe object. Make sure it sits outside the component for the page.\\n\\n```js\\n// import stripe js\\nimport { loadStripe } from \\\"@stripe/stripe-js\\\";\\n\\n// Make sure to call `loadStripe` outside of a component’s render to avoid\\n// recreating the `Stripe` object on every render.\\nconst stripePromise = loadStripe(\\n  `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}`\\n);\\n```\\n\\nWe now need to create the following pages `success.js` and `canceled.js` to be added to the `pages` folder.\\n\\nThe `success.js` file will have the following:\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport Head from \\\"next/head\\\";\\nimport Link from \\\"next/link\\\";\\nimport { Layout } from \\\"../components/layout\\\";\\n\\nexport default function Success() {\\n  return (\\n    <>\\n      <Head>\\n        <title>Order Success</title>\\n        <meta name=\\\"description\\\" content=\\\"Products\\\" />\\n      </Head>\\n      <Layout>\\n        <h1>Order Success</h1>\\n        <p>Thanks for ordering.</p>\\n\\n        <Link href=\\\"/\\\">Return to products</Link>\\n      </Layout>\\n    </>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe `canceled.js` will have the following:\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport Head from \\\"next/head\\\";\\nimport Link from \\\"next/link\\\";\\nimport { Layout } from \\\"../components/layout\\\";\\n\\nexport default function Canceled() {\\n  return (\\n    <>\\n      <Head>\\n        <title>Order Canceled</title>\\n        <meta name=\\\"description\\\" content=\\\"Products\\\" />\\n      </Head>\\n      <Layout>\\n        <h1>Order canceled</h1>\\n        <p>Your order has been canceled.</p>\\n        <Link href=\\\"/\\\">Return to products</Link>\\n      </Layout>\\n    </>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn the `checkout_sessions.js` file we supply a `success_url` and a `canceled_url` value. This is where we redirect the user from the checkout page.\\n\\nWhen you click on the \\\"Buy Now\\\" button you will be redirected to the Stripe checkout, like in the image below.\\n\\n{% image \\\"./stripe-checkout.png\\\", \\\"The hosted Stripe checkout\\\" %}\\n\\nIf you complete the purchase, then you will be directed to the success page.\\n\\n{% image \\\"./order-success.png\\\", \\\"Successful order\\\" %}\\n\\nOtherwise if you click the left arrow / back you will be redirected to the cancel page.\\n\\n{% image \\\"./canceled-order.png\\\", \\\"Canceled order\\\" %}\\n\\nWe have now completed the display of products and have the checkout page working correctly. Well done. 👏\\n\\nYou can checkout the GitHub repository for this project to see the finished result. Please note there are branches for each step. Alternatively you can view the repository on CodeSandbox.\\n\\nFor more help with setting up Stripe checkout take a look at the documentation on the Stripe website.\\n\\n{% include \\\"promos/seriesstripenextjs.njk\\\" %}\\n\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"gj0hGZoY9UJ/VqDZzehAXD5e/5L0DWFMAg0AkkBcCzw=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md_1":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md_1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md\",\"file_name\":\"shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"---\\ntitle: Build a shop with Next.js and Stripe - Display the products from Stripe\\ndate: \\\"2022-10-16T07:29:45Z\\\"\\ntemplate: post\\ndraft: false\\nslug: \\\"shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products\\\"\\ncategory: article\\ntags:\\n  - nextjs\\n  - stripe\\n  - shop\\n  - products\\n  - series\\ndescription: Continuing with the Next.js & Stripe online shop we now will display the products from Stripe.\\nsocialBackground: bg5\\nogimage: \\\"product-api.png\\\"\\n---\\n\\n{% include \\\"promos/seriesstripenextjs.njk\\\" %}\\n\\nyoutube.com/embed/OiHx3Zouj_w\\n\\nContinuing with the Next.js & Stripe online shop series we now will display the products.\\n\\nWe first need to get the products from Stripe and we need to do that securely and not expose our secret Stripe key.\\nSo let's start with creating a new file called `products.js` in the `/pages/api/` folder.\\n\\nWe need to install the **stripe** NPM package first. Run the following command to install it:\\n\\n```shell\\nnpm install --save stripe\\n```\\n\\nAdd the following to the `products.js` file:\\n\\n```js\\nconst stripe = require(\\\"stripe\\\")(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);\\n\\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\\n  try {\\n    const products = await stripe.products.list({\\n      limit: 100,\\n    });\\n\\n    res.status(200).json(products);\\n  } catch (err) {\\n    res.status(500).json({ message: err.message });\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nBy default the products can only be retrieved on the same origin ensuring that only our own shop can retrieve the products.\\n\\nLet's test our API retrieves our products when running locally. You should be able to see the JSON returned.\\n\\n{% image \\\"./product-api.png\\\", \\\"Response from the product API\\\" %}\\n\\nBefore we do anything else we need to create a _HOST_ environment variable. Open the `.env.local` file and add the following:\\n\\n```shell\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"96bcQKoXN+5mkRALAIM2xqoZfGHES5gZRlLR/wg7t2w=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md_2":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md_2\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md\",\"file_name\":\"shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\n\\n# add HOST\\nHOST=http://localhost:3000\\n```\\n\\nWe will use the _HOST_ environment variable now, to prepend to our request to the API. Let's update the `index.js` file in the `pages` directory and add the following (outlined in the orange comments):\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport Head from \\\"next/head\\\";\\nimport { Layout } from \\\"../components/layout\\\";\\n\\n// Pass the products object to the Home page\\nexport default function Home({ products }) {\\n  return (\\n    <>\\n      <Head>\\n        <title>Products</title>\\n        <meta name=\\\"description\\\" content=\\\"Products\\\" />\\n      </Head>\\n      <Layout>\\n        {/* Need to pass products.data to the Products component */}\\n        <Products products={products.data} />\\n      </Layout>\\n    </>\\n  );\\n}\\n// Add getServerSideProps so we can return the data from server-side\\nexport async function getServerSideProps() {\\n  // Fetch data from external API\\n  const res = await fetch(`${process.env.HOST}/api/products`);\\n  const products = await res.json();\\n\\n  // Pass data to the page via props\\n  return { props: { products } };\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis will retrieve the products via a server side request so the page can pre-render. We now need a component to display this product information. To do this we will create a new javascript file called `products.js` in the `components` folder.\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport React from \\\"react\\\";\\nimport Image from \\\"next/image\\\";\\nimport styles from \\\"../styles/products.module.css\\\";\\n\\nexport const Products = ({ products }) => {\\n  return (\\n    <>\\n      {/* Check that we have products */}\\n      {products.length ? (\\n        <ul className={styles.products}>\\n          {/* Iterate over the products */}\\n          {products.map((product) => (\\n            <li key={product.id}>\\n              {/* Note that we are using a form to post to the API we just created */}\\n              <form action=\\\"/api/checkout_sessions\\\" method=\\\"POST\\\">\\n                {/* Display the product image using the Next Image component */}\\n                <Image\\n                  src={product.images[0]}\\n                  alt={`Image of ${product.name}`}\\n                  layout={\\\"responsive\\\"}\\n                  width={0}\\n                  height={0}\\n                  priority={true}\\n                />\\n                <h2>{product.name}</h2>\\n                <p>{product.description}</p>\\n                <button type=\\\"submit\\\" role=\\\"link\\\" className={styles.link}>\\n                  Buy Now\\n                </button>\\n                {/* The ID of the product so the user can purchase */}\\n                <input\\n                  type=\\\"hidden\\\"\\n                  name=\\\"priceId\\\"\\n                  value={product.default_price}\\n                />\\n              </form>\\n            </li>\\n          ))}\\n        </ul>\\n      ) : (\\n        <div>No products</div>\\n      )}\\n    </>\\n  );\\n};\\n```\\n\\nNotice in the above example we take advantage of the Next.js Image component. This component is great for displaying optimised versions of your images serving the correct sized image for the device/screen they are being served to.\\n\\nWe also need to create a CSS module for the product component, create a new file called `products.module.css` in the `styles` folder.\\n\\n```css\\n.link {\\n  display: inline-block;\\n  background-color: var(--primary-color);\\n  color: #fff;\\n  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;\\n  border-radius: 0.2rem;\\n  border: 1px solid var(--primary-color);\\n}\\n.link:hover {\\n  background-color: #fff;\\n  color: var(--primary-color);\\n}\\n.promotion {\\n  display: grid;\\n  grid-template-columns: 1fr;\\n  list-style: none;\\n  gap: 1rem;\\n  padding: 0;\\n}\\n@media screen and (min-width: 50rem) {\\n  .promotion {\\n    /* 2 columns */\\n    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;\\n  }\\n}\\n@media screen and (min-width: 70rem) {\\n  .promotion {\\n    /* 3 columns */\\n    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe last step to get our images to display from Stripe is to update the `next.config.js` file with a parameter to allow us to retrieve the images from stripe.com. We can do this by adding the following:\\n\\n```js\\nmodule.exports = {\\n  reactStrictMode: true,\\n  // Add this to allow images to be retrieved from stripe.com\\n  images: {\\n    domains: [\\\"files.stripe.com\\\"],\\n  },\\n};\\n```\\n\\nWhen loading the page for your shop locally you should now see a list of products available like the following:\\n\\n{% image \\\"./shop-with-products.png\\\", \\\"Products listed\\\" %}\\n\\nOur products are displaying now because we used `getServerSideProps` to retrieve the products server side. The product information is retrieved before rendering and served server side (information will be displayed even if JavaScript is disabled). Great for search engines to be able to index your products.\\n\\nNext, we will add the cart and purchase functionality so someone could buy one of our products.\\n\\n{% include \\\"promos/seriesstripenextjs.njk\\\" %}\\n\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"6+bNdsvFI1tZhnqw6XzEuSp6MU7pq4ayd1JUpe380jM=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/shop-nextjs-stripe-introduction.md_1":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/shop-nextjs-stripe-introduction.md_1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/shop-nextjs-stripe-introduction.md\",\"file_name\":\"shop-nextjs-stripe-introduction.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"---\\ntitle: Build a shop with Next.js and Stripe\\ndate: \\\"2021-12-03T22:02:38Z\\\"\\ntemplate: post\\ndraft: false\\nslug: \\\"shop-nextjs-stripe-introduction\\\"\\ncategory: article\\ntags:\\n  - nextjs\\n  - stripe\\n  - shop\\n  - series\\ndescription: Introducing a new series on how to build a shop using Next.js and Stripe\\nsocialBackground: bg5\\nogimage: \\\"nextjs-start.png\\\"\\n---\\n\\n{% include \\\"promos/seriesstripenextjs.njk\\\" %}\\n\\nyoutube.com/embed/-3rN4US4xzo\\n\\nIn this series I'm going to walk through the process of building an online shop using the React Framework Next.js. You may have built a website before using the likes of Create React App which will get you the bare bones together to start building. But it doesn't get you that far before you have a huge amount of decisions to make. What routing should I use for my pages? What CSS in JS library? Should I use Tailwind? Will my website have good SEO? Very quickly you can be overloaded with decisions. This stems mostly from the fact that React is not a framework. It's a _library_.\\n\\nNext.js on the other hand is **\\\"The React Framework for Production\\\"**. With it a lot of the decisions have been made for you, letting you get up and running much faster. More importantly it solves a lot of the common problems that building a website/web app entail.\\n\\nYou will need to have an understanding of HTML, CSS and React of course to follow along with this series. I teach all these subjects at Developers Institute where I'm a Tech Lead 😉\\n\\nTo get started building a Next.js application, hopefully you have Node installed ( if not download here ) and open up your terminal.\\n\\n```shell\\nnpx create-next-app@latest\\n```\\n\\nFollow the prompts and give it a name \\\"shop-nextjs-stripe\\\"\\n\\nHead into the directory with your new project and start the local development.\\n\\n```shell\\ncd shop-nextjs-stripe\\nnpm run dev\\n```\\n\\nOpen your code editor and take a look at the folder structure. You will see 3 folders. The \\\"pages\\\" folder is where the routing happens. That will direct the url page in your app. For example if you had a file called `contact-us.js` to be routed to it you would have the following url your browser `http://localhost:3000/contact-us`. This will show the content from that component.\\n\\nYour **pages** folder will have a **api** folder and two files `_app.js` and `index.js`.\\n\\nOpen the project in a browser and you should see something like this\\n\\n{% image \\\"./nextjs-start.png\\\", \\\"Next.JS Starter\\\" %}\\n\\nGreat the project is up and running in development mode 🙌\\n\\nIn your code editor (I suggest you use VS Code) we will open the `index.js` file in the `pages` folder.\\n\\nWe are going to remove everything and replace it with the following:\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport Head from \\\"next/head\\\";\\n\\nexport default function Home() {\\n  return (\\n    <>\\n      <Head>\\n        <title>Products</title>\\n        <meta name=\\\"description\\\" content=\\\"Products\\\" />\\n      </Head>\\n    </>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThat's cleared the standard install documentation links. Time to make our first component. Let's make a new folder called `components` and add a file `layout.js` in that directory. Add the following:\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport React from \\\"react\\\";\\nimport Head from \\\"next/head\\\";\\n\\nimport styles from \\\"../styles/layout.module.css\\\";\\n\\nexport const Layout = ({ children }) => {\\n  return (\\n    <>\\n      <Head>\\n        <link rel=\\\"icon\\\" href=\\\"/favicon.ico\\\" />\\n      </Head>\\n      <div className={styles.container}>\\n        <main className={styles.main}>{children}</main>\\n      </div>\\n    </>\\n  );\\n};\\n```\\n\\nThis will be the layout shared across all our pages in the shop. To add to that we will add a Header and a Footer component.\\n\\nAgain in the `components` folder create a `header.js` and a `footer.js` file.\\n\\nIn the header file add the following:\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport React from \\\"react\\\";\\n\\nexport const Header = () => {\\n  return <header></header>;\\n};\\n```\\n\\nIn the footer file add the following:\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport React from \\\"react\\\";\\n\\nexport const Footer = () => {\\n  return <footer></footer>;\\n};\\n```\\n\\nWe need to update the layout component like so (see the comments in the code):\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport React from \\\"react\\\";\\nimport Head from \\\"next/head\\\";\\n\\n// Add the following imports\\nimport { Header } from \\\"./header\\\";\\nimport { Footer } from \\\"./footer\\\";\\n\\nimport styles from \\\"../styles/layout.module.css\\\";\\n\\nexport const Layout = ({ children }) => {\\n  return (\\n    <>\\n      <Head>\\n        <link rel=\\\"icon\\\" href=\\\"/favicon.ico\\\" />\\n      </Head>\\n      {/* Add the Header */}\\n      <Header />\\n      <div className={styles.container}>\\n        <main className={styles.main}>{children}</main>\\n      </div>\\n      {/* Add the Footer */}\\n      <Footer />\\n    </>\\n  );\\n};\\n```\\n\\nWe now have a Layout component we can re-use throughout our application with the Header and Footer on every page. We can pass the content for the page via the **children** prop.\\n\\nYou may have noticed we have a reference to a CSS module but haven't added that to the `styles` folder yet. By default Next.js supports CSS modules, the major benefit with CSS modules is we can avoid CSS name collisions (it makes unique CSS class names) and feel comfortable to delete an unused CSS file as we know it's only relevant to one component. CSS Tricks has a series on CSS Modules worth reading to get a better understanding.\\n\\nNotice that the corresponding CSS classes above are referenced as a JavaScript object e.g.\\n\\n```jsx\\n<div className={styles.container}>\\n```\\n\\nLet's add the CSS and it's file. Create a `layout.module.css` file in the `styles` folder with the following code:\\n\\n```css\\n.container {\\n  min-height: 90vh;\\n  display: flex;\\n  flex-direction: column;\\n  justify-content: flex-start;\\n}\\n.main {\\n  padding: 5.3rem 0 1rem 0;\\n  margin: 0;\\n  flex: 1;\\n  display: flex;\\n  flex-direction: column;\\n  align-items: center;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow we can add the Layout component to every page. Let's add it to the `index.js`:\\n\\n```js\\nimport Head from \\\"next/head\\\";\\nimport styles from \\\"../styles/Home.module.css\\\";\\n\\n// Import the layout components\\nimport { Layout } from \\\"../components/layout\\\";\\n\\nexport default function Home() {\\n  return (\\n    <>\\n      <Head>\\n        <title>Products</title>\\n        <meta name=\\\"description\\\" content=\\\"Products\\\" />\\n      </Head>\\n\\n      {/* Add the Layout component to the Home page. */}\\n      <Layout></Layout>\\n    </>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\nLet's start putting some content in to the Header component. Let's start off by adding some `<div>` tags to store a logo and some icons.\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport React from \\\"react\\\";\\n\\nimport styles from \\\"../styles/header.module.css\\\";\\n\\nexport const Header = () => {\\n  return (\\n    <header className={styles.header}>\\n      <div className={styles.mainNav}>\\n        <div className={styles.iconNav}>\\n          <nav></nav>\\n        </div>\\n      </div>\\n    </header>\\n  );\\n};\\n```\\n\\nAnd the subsequent CSS styles\\n\\n```css\\n.header {\\n  width: 100%;\\n  height: 4.4rem;\\n  border-bottom: 1px solid #eaeaea;\\n  display: flex;\\n  justify-content: center;\\n  align-items: center;\\n  position: fixed;\\n  background-color: var(--bg-color);\\n  z-index: 10;\\n}\\n.iconNav ul {\\n  list-style: none;\\n  display: flex;\\n}\\n.mainNav {\\n  display: flex;\\n  justify-content: space-between;\\n  width: 100%;\\n  max-width: var(--max-cont-width);\\n}\\n.logo {\\n  color: var(--font-color);\\n  cursor: pointer;\\n  width: 4rem;\\n  height: 4rem;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWe also need to update the `global.css` file with these variables. Add them to the very top of the file.\\n\\n```css\\n:root {\\n  --font-color: #111;\\n  --icon-color: #111;\\n  --bg-color: #fff;\\n  --max-cont-width: 63rem;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTime to add some icons, we are going to use Heroicons in this project. In the terminal run:\\n\\n```shell\\nnpm i @heroicons/react\\n```\\n\\nWe can add them to the `header.js` file like so.\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport React from \\\"react\\\";\\n\\n// icons added\\nimport {\\n  MagnifyingGlassIcon,\\n  BuildingStorefrontIcon,\\n  Bars3Icon,\\n} from \\\"@heroicons/react/24/solid\\\";\\n\\n// outline icon added\\nimport { ShoppingBagIcon } from \\\"@heroicons/react/24/outline\\\";\\n\\nimport styles from \\\"../styles/header.module.css\\\";\\n\\nexport const Header = () => {\\n  return (\\n    <header className={styles.header}>\\n      <div className={styles.mainNav}>\\n        <BuildingStorefrontIcon className={styles.logo} />\\n\\n        <div className={styles.iconNav}>\\n          <nav>\\n            <ul>\\n              <li>\\n                <MagnifyingGlassIcon className={styles.searchIcon} />\\n              </li>\\n              <li>\\n                <ShoppingBagIcon className={styles.cartIcon} />\\n              </li>\\n              <li>\\n                <Bars3Icon className={styles.menuIcon} />\\n              </li>\\n            </ul>\\n          </nav>\\n        </div>\\n      </div>\\n    </header>\\n  );\\n};\\n```\\n\\nAlso add corresponding CSS for the icons.\\n\\n```css\\n.searchIcon {\\n  width: 1.5em;\\n  height: 1.5em;\\n  color: var(--icon-color);\\n  margin-right: 0.5rem;\\n}\\n.cartIcon {\\n  width: 1.5em;\\n  height: 1.5em;\\n  color: var(--icon-color);\\n  margin-right: 0.5rem;\\n}\\n.menuIcon {\\n  width: 1.5em;\\n  height: 1.5em;\\n  color: var(--icon-color);\\n  margin-right: 0.5rem;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWe are almost done, lets add a footer and style it.\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport React from \\\"react\\\";\\nimport styles from \\\"../styles/footer.module.css\\\";\\n\\nexport const Footer = () => {\\n  return (\\n    <footer className={styles.footer}>\\n      <div className={styles.footerCont}>\\n        <nav className={styles.footerNav}>\\n          <ul>\\n            <li>Find a Store</li>\\n            <li>Sign up for Email</li>\\n            <li>Become a Member</li>\\n            <li>Feedback</li>\\n          </ul>\\n        </nav>\\n        <div className={styles.copyright}>&copy; 2022 Online Shop</div>\\n      </div>\\n    </footer>\\n  );\\n};\\n```\\n\\nAdd a new file to the styles folder `footer.module.css`. Then add the following CSS.\\n\\n```css\\n.footer {\\n  width: 100%;\\n  height: 11rem;\\n  display: flex;\\n  justify-content: center;\\n  align-items: center;\\n  background-color: var(--font-color);\\n  color: #fff;\\n  flex-direction: column;\\n}\\n.footerCont {\\n  max-width: var(--max-cont-width);\\n  margin: 0 auto;\\n  padding: 0 1.6rem;\\n  width: 100%;\\n}\\n.footerNav ul {\\n  display: flex;\\n  flex-direction: column;\\n  list-style: none;\\n  margin: 0;\\n  padding: 0;\\n}\\n.footerNav li {\\n  padding: 0.3rem 0;\\n  text-transform: uppercase;\\n  font-size: 0.8rem;\\n}\\n.copyright {\\n  font-size: 0.8rem;\\n  opacity: 0.8;\\n  margin-top: 0.6rem;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n{% image \\\"./shop-header-footer-chrome.png\\\", \\\"Progress so far of the header and footer\\\" %}\\n\\nAlright that's quite a bit we've done here, congrats if you got this far 👍.

The app will function in the same way but look different for each corresponding theme with alternate fonts, colours and logo etc. This can be a big headache, and you can be left maintaining multiple copies of the same code base. In an ideal world we don't want to do that.\\n\\nI found myself at work in this exact scenario. We had a need for multiple themes/branding but at the apps core it had the same functionality. I needed to use the same code base for this ReactJS app. Most importantly I needed to have flexibility and have options to hide and show form fields, components etc if needed for different themes. I also wanted to have an easy way to switch which theme/brand the app was using across the board at the deployment level. So same GIT repository, 3 different deployments (domains), all hosted on Azure.\\n\\nAt work we use Tailwind CSS which is a utility first CSS framework. Rather than making custom CSS classes for each part of a component you are working on, you add multiple utility classes to each element and never run the issue of another developer (or your self in the future) breaking your design. CSS classes stay consistent and in practise I've found you only need to add on the off occasion a custom CSS class.\\n\\nTo achieve the theming of Tailwind I used a plugin called tailwind-theme-variants. This allowed me to create 3 variants. We will call them Alpha, Beta, Gamma. Each have there own brand colours. So anywhere through out the application I can prefix the brand name and a colon to a CSS class for example and know it will only be shown for that theme. Just like when using the responsive classes in Tailwind CSS.\\n\\n```jsx\\n<div className=\\\"alpha:bg-alpha-color1 beta:bg-beta-color1 gamma:bg-gamma-color1 text-sm\\\">\\n  My component\\n</div>\\n```\\n\\nIn the example above when the user is looking at the **alpha** themed version of the app this component will have the background colour of alpha colour 1 (**<span style=\\\"border-bottom: 3px solid azure;\\\">azure</span>**). Versus the **gamma** themed version will have the background colour of gamma colour 1 (**<span style=\\\"border-bottom: 3px solid ghostwhite\\\">ghostwhite</span>**). This allows some great flexibility to theme your app while at the same time making it easy to manage.\\n\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"aP1IUgroDbU7u0F4EEhpcAW5EpdMxTDYwUrZsXM4Arg=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/tailwind-theming-by-config.md_2":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/tailwind-theming-by-config.md_2\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/tailwind-theming-by-config.md\",\"file_name\":\"tailwind-theming-by-config.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\n\\n## Final result\\n\\nFirst off lets look at the final results.

Every class meeting is online, with the likes of Zoom or Google Meet. Communication between staff and students is via Slack instant messaging. Course exercises, projects and learning materials are all delivered via our web-based LMS (Learner Management System) iQualify (in the form of videos, tutorials, exercises and quizzes).\\n\\nYou lean into technology is how. Every week new tools are released that you can incorporate into your education practices. We have seen the most significant growth in Machine Learning technology with the increase in the ability of Large Language Models at an almost frightening pace. Since late last year, we have seen huge jumps in the capability of generative AI art models to produce fantastic images from simple text prompts. We have seen all the GPT (Generative pre-trained transformer) tools like ChatGPT, for example, that given short text prompts can produce answers for simple facts to writing history essays. What’s even more exciting is the adoption of the technology companies adding these capabilities to products we already use and love. AI answers have now been incorporated into searches on Bing and Google, so your answers are provided directly in the search engine itself. Adobe has added generative image creation into Photoshop to create extraordinary images with text prompts. Canva can produce multiple templates on the fly from a user uploading an image and some colour prompts.\\n\\nWe have benefitted significantly at Developers Institute by integrating digital learning into our practices. What was once an in-person school in Whangarei teaching Software Development in a class environment. We now teach students from all over the motu in Aotearoa to even some overseas online by embracing digital technology in our teaching practices. But there are still more tools we can embrace to benefit the learners.\\n\\nOne of these ways is to incorporate ChatGPT as another tool for our students to get support in their learning, exercises and projects. With ChatGPT, there can always be help available to answer questions at any time. ChatGPT was trained on a large portion of code on GitHub, the collaborative version control software that hosts an extensive collection of open-source projects. Because of this, it can answer most questions about code syntax and provide examples for learners. Say a learner wanted to know how to fetch some data in a format called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) using the JavaScript programming language. They could ask this to ChatGPT, which would explain with an example code like in the screenshot below. The answer has a step-by-step breakdown of what needs to happen, an example snippet of code and a summary explaining how it works.\\n\\n{% figure \\\"./js-fetch-chatgpt.png\\\", \\\"ChatGPT fetch example\\\" %}\\n\\nTo ensure new and existing learners can take advantage of this incredible technology, we are planning on creating a supplementary course in our learner management system that will cover the following items (Fraiwan et al., 2023)[^1]:\\n\\n- Personalised learning experiences: Tools like ChatGPT can help by suggesting learning resources, addressing student inquiries and offering feedback.\\n- Code Generation: Like in the previous example above, ChatGPT can help solve coding problems or provide guidance on how to approach a programming problem. The learner can describe a problem in words and/or code snippets to help solve an issue.\\n- Debugging: Assist in identifying errors and suggesting fixes.\\n\\nThe course will be a mix of documentation on advising on how to write prompts for ChatGPT and video screencast tutorials where teach leads (our industry-aligned name for teachers) in our teaching team will walk through real-life examples and demonstrations on common issues our learners have previously had. Just like learners would have previously learnt how to use a search engine like Google, they will be taught how to interact with ChatGPT and what prompts can elicit different responses. While ChatGPT is a valuable tool, we will also have to remind our learners that it is an early technology tool and not infallible, it still has issues with “hallucinations” of facts that are entirely fabricated, a concept popularised by Google AI researchers (Agarwal et al., 2018)[^2]. Learners must verify answers with reliable sources, official documentation, or via our learner support team.\\n\\nGitHub Copilot is a plugin for Visual Studio Code, the IDE (integrated development environment) we use at the Developers Institute. It is an extension of a developer's work environment and acts as an AI pair programmer that helps one write code. It does this by prompting suggested code based on the context of your existing code and interpreting code comments. It will show this suggested code in the grey text beside the cursor. If it seems satisfactory, pressing the tab key will embed this suggestion into your code base. The suggestions can be from a simple line to multiple lines, depending on what the AI model predicts you will use. It will also suggest multiple options, generally more than one. If unhappy, use the “Next\\\" suggestion keyboard shortcut. The predictions/suggestions will even use the declared variables in your existing code.\\n\\n{% figure \\\"./vscode-copilot.png\\\", \\\"Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot\\\" %}\\n\\nThe benefits that most developers find when using Copilot are the following:\\n\\n- Productivity increased: Copilot can improve productivity by providing context-relevant code suggestions when needed. Stopping a developer from needing to switch contexts and having to look up documentation (Peng et al., 2023)[^3].\\n- Generating tests: When writing code for software development, it is best practice to write tests to ensure your code is working correctly. Often this can be a mind-numbing task doing simple checks to ensure that when two known values are passed to a function, the expected results are always the same every time the function is run. You can ensure this is the case by writing tests (small pieces of code to check) that test the boundaries of happy and negative paths. Copilot is integrated into your IDE, so it is aware of your code's functions. It knows the expected parameters and can generate these small tests, saving lots of time on repetitive coding (Wermelinger, 2023)[^4].\\n\\nWe plan to integrate Copilot with the previously mentioned course with ChatGPT. Again adding screencasts and tutorials on how to make the most of it. This course will be called \\\"Enhancing Development with AI\\\", which we plan to be 2-3 weeks of content and can be completed after our first program in the student's software development journey as a supplementary self-paced online course. That way, existing students and new learners alike can up-skill.\\n\\nAnother great tool that enables collaborative learning between students and teaching staff is GitHub Codespaces. It is a cloud-based development environment. It allows you to code as if using Visual Studio Code, in the cloud via a browser (or your local copy of VS Code). There is no need to set up a local environment to install Node.js or Python (or whatever language you require) and necessary dependencies etc.\\n\\n{% figure \\\"./vscode-codespaces.png\\\", \\\"Visual Studio Code using Codespaces\\\" %}\\n\\nSome of the benefits of Codespaces are the following (Malan, 2022)[^5]:\\n\\n- Consistent and accessible coding environment: Regardless of the computing device, it's possible to code on complicated multiple-tier applications from an iPad or Chromebook as the code runs in the cloud.\\n- Rapid onboarding and sharing: Students and staff can quickly set up and start working on a shared project or exercise in a class without the hassle of setting up a local development environment. The Codespaces can be configured with all tools and dependencies near instantly.\\n- Collaboration and code review: It's common to support our learners by needing to run their exercise or project to help them debug. We must find their Git repository, clone it locally to our local development environment (computer), and install all the dependencies to provide support. With Codespaces, we can quickly deploy in the cloud and share the same code in seconds.\\n\\nIn the long term, we plan to migrate our existing exercises and projects to use development containers config files to take advantage of Codespaces, locally or in the cloud. With many exercises to convert, it will take some time to complete.\\n\\nFinally, we want to embed environmentally sustainable software practises into our course. We want to minimise the impact of software systems on our environment by reducing energy consumption and using green energy, reducing carbon emissions.\\n\\nThere are several ways to do this:\\n\\n- Green (Cloud) Hosting: Choosing environmentally friendly hosting options. For example, Microsoft is powering their data centres with carbon-zero power and has just signed a 10-year power purchase agreement with Contact Energy to supply geothermal energy (NZX, 2023)[^6].\\n- Energy efficiency and optimisation: Teach energy-efficient programming practices and techniques where resources are minimised, and we attempt to reduce unnecessary compute time. Thus reducing the energy consumption of servers (Abhishek et al., 2021)[^7].\\n- Promote reduced cost: By optimising efficiency, the software can require smaller servers to reduce the cost of hosting. The reduced cost benefit is an easy sell to employers.\\n\\nIf each graduate can help make environmentally sustainable efforts for software development in Aotearoa more common, we can get a little closer to our reduction of greenhouse gas emissions goals of 2030, and reduce the impact of climate change.\\n\\nIn conclusion, as a remote school heavily relying on technology, it's important to continue innovating in education to enhance the student's learning experience. We need to educate students in tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to assist and support them when practising to become software developers. Allowing collaboration and learning to be more accessible to staff and learners by easily sharing their current issue(s) without frustration and hassle using Codespaces. We need them to go into the industry with a good grasp of environmental sustainability concerning software development to help with impending climate change. Incorporating these tools and knowledge into our teaching practices will ensure Developers Institute is at the forefront of digital and collaborative learning.\\n\\n[^1]: Mohammad Fraiwan, Natheer Khasawneh (2023).

It lets you style your HTML content by appending a multitude of predefined utility CSS classes to your HTML elements. For example say you were creating a Card component with a heading, description and image using ReactJS.\\n\\n```jsx\\nconst Card = ({ heading, description, image }) => {\\n  return (\\n    <div className=\\\"cardContainer\\\">\\n      <img src={image} className=\\\"cardImage\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />\\n      <div>\\n        <h3 className=\\\"cardHeading\\\">{heading}</h3>\\n        <div className=\\\"cardDescription\\\">{description}</div>\\n      </div>\\n    </div>\\n  );\\n};\\n```\\n\\nUsing standard CSS we would create classes for all the elements in our Card component like the example above. This would require us to create these individual classes in a CSS file. In this scenario there are two things that need to be done:\\n\\n1. Name our CSS class names: Naming can be difficult, especially when multiple team members are involved. It can lead to confusion, for example, if one person refers to a component as a \\\"tile\\\" and another calls it a \\\"card.\\\"\\n2. Duplication: Repeating the same CSS properties multiple times throughout the CSS file(s) e.g. `margin: 0` and `padding: 1rem` we can end up with a mess that most developers on your team would be afraid to change for fear of regression issues.\\n\\n```css\\n.cardContainer {\\n  border-radius: 0.75rem;\\n  display: flex;\\n  gap: 0.5rem;\\n  margin-bottom: 1rem;\\n  padding: 1rem;\\n  background-color: white;\\n  box-shadow: 0 0 #0000, 0 0 #0000, 0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1), 0 4px\\n      6px -4px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1);\\n}\\n.cardHeading {\\n  font-weight: bold;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nCompare this to the same component but this time using CSS classes from Tailwind CSS below. Initially it's a shock to see such a mess of CSS classes for each HTML element. But each class is easy to remember as they map to existing CSS properties, and will not be repeated in the CSS file.\\n\\n```jsx\\nconst Card = ({ heading, description, image }) => {\\n  return (\\n    <div className=\\\"rounded-xl shadow-lg bg-white p-4 mb-4 flex gap-2\\\">\\n      <img src={image} className=\\\"rounded-lg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />\\n      <div>\\n        <h3 className=\\\"font-bold\\\">{heading}</h3>\\n        <div className=\\\"font-serif\\\">{description}</div>\\n      </div>\\n    </div>\\n  );\\n};\\n```\\n\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"grIa3gLFGgkPfZPirj5E0XLfe4U7MOiagXeQF13eD40=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/what-is-tailwind-css.md_2":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/what-is-tailwind-css.md_2\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/what-is-tailwind-css.md\",\"file_name\":\"what-is-tailwind-css.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\n\\n## Why should I use Tailwind CSS?\\n\\nSo why would you use Tailwind and pollute your components with all these class names?\\n\\nThe most common answer to why is you don't have to worry about naming classes or naming collisions in your CSS. Instead you can just get on with using the CSS properties you already know and set about applying them to your HTML elements. You don't even need to view the CSS file. You can just remain working on the component with the occasional look at the Tailwind documentation.\\n\\nSome more reasons to use Tailwind CSS are:\\n\\n- DRY: No repetition of code in your CSS files, `margin-left: 1rem` is only declared once in your stylesheet. CSS property declarations are DRY so aren't repeated\\n- Lack of confusion: No confusion of naming as all members of the team use the pre-existing CSS class names instead of creating new CSS classes\\n- Speed: Tailwind CSS provides pre-defined CSS classes that can be used to quickly style elements, allowing developers to focus on building the structure and functionality of their website or application.\\n- Consistency: By using the same pre-defined classes throughout the project, developers can ensure that the design is consistent across all pages and components.\\n- Customization: Tailwind CSS allows developers to customize the default styles and generate new classes with specific variations, giving more flexibility and control over the design.\\n- Accessibility: Tailwind CSS provides a set of utility classes to help implement accessibility best practices, such as providing sufficient contrast and using semantic HTML elements.\\n- Performance: Tailwind CSS allows you to only include the CSS you need (via a clever build process), leading to smaller CSS file sizes and faster load times for your website or application.\\n\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"f17WNh9cTlCk77mqvzwf7LBk/Hj7eiGQuH+sJN5M0eo=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/what-is-tailwind-css.md_3":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/what-is-tailwind-css.md_3\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/what-is-tailwind-css.md\",\"file_name\":\"what-is-tailwind-css.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\n\\n## What makes the Tailwind CSS developer experience (DX) good?\\n\\nIn terms of developer experience once you get over it looking like horrible **tag soup** with all those CSS classes scattered through your HTML/JSX files you will start to notice a couple of things:\\n\\n- Tailwind CSS is ideal in team situations. By default, you don't have naming conflicts and there are no confusion about names as styling is done at the property level.\\n- The use of the Tailwind Labs official plugin for VS Code enable autocomplete functionality. If you already know the name of CSS properties and have used the likes of Bootstrap for padding and margin you will quickly feel familiar with Tailwind.\\n- Another benefit is that you aren't changing the CSS, instead you are working on the HTML so there is little chance of breaking styling for other parts of your website.\\n- You will only have to do a minimal amount of CSS work for the likes of theming or specific custom styles which means your CSS won't grow in size much at all. In fact with the build process your HTML can be scanned to look for the CSS classes and determine if they are not used and can be removed from the CSS file of the website. Therefore only creating a CSS file with the CSS classes used.\\n- As the padding and margin values are predefined you won't get the same padding value declared multiple times scattered through your CSS file. You can also check at a glance are elements sharing the same padding or margin by the CSS classes applied without having to use the browser dev tools or find the class in the CSS.\\n- No need to write media queries as instead you can use the utility classes outlined here in the vein of `md:w-32` to only apply the CSS class on the page being **medium** sized.\\n\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"SoOqUAyn4BB/HTyI8fIKSgL4Tx7EgDcbklvo3Lq57W8=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/what-is-tailwind-css.md_4":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/what-is-tailwind-css.md_4\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/what-is-tailwind-css.md\",\"file_name\":\"what-is-tailwind-css.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\n\\n## When should I use Tailwind CSS?\\n\\nBased on my experience, Tailwind CSS is most effective when used on a team where some or most of the developers have limited CSS skills. Establishing a consistent design system using CSS can be a time-consuming process. It requires a solid understanding of CSS as well as strong communication skills to establish a process and create a style guide that all team members must adhere to, instead of relying on \\\"janky\\\" CSS hacks for the desired look from StackOverflow.\\n\\nTailwind CSS can simplify the documentation process by providing comprehensive documentation and resources for getting started, both from the official Tailwind developers and the community. This can make it easier to understand and implement.\\n\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"6AyVAsif1slAFizsovxiws5+Jgf9UnOdHWd2mz1sMnY=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/what-is-tailwind-css.md_5":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/what-is-tailwind-css.md_5\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/what-is-tailwind-css.md\",\"file_name\":\"what-is-tailwind-css.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\n\\n## What are the downsides of Tailwind CSS?\\n\\nAlthough Tailwind CSS offers many benefits, there are some drawbacks that could affect both the short-term and long-term success of your project:\\n\\n- File size: Tailwind requires a large number of CSS classes to be added to your HTML, which can lead to longer page load times and larger file sizes if not optimized properly.\\n- Learning curve: Tailwind CSS requires a different approach to writing CSS, which can take some time to learn and adjust to.\\n- Opinionated design: Tailwind CSS provides pre-defined classes that can be used to quickly style elements, but it also imposes a specific design aesthetic that may not align with the desired look and feel of the website or application.\\n- Overuse of classes: Using too many classes on a single element can make the HTML difficult to read and understand, leading to a more complex and harder to maintain codebase.\\n- Customization: Tailwind CSS is highly customizable, but this can also lead to increased complexity in terms of configuration, and can make it harder to maintain the design consistency across the project.\\n- Hard to remove: It can be challenging to remove Tailwind CSS once it has been implemented. This is because the embedded Tailwind classes are present throughout your HTML, component, or template files, and removing them incrementally can create conflicts with the Tailwind build system. Additionally, it may further complicate the project by requiring an additional build process for the new setup to incrementally replace styling.\\n- Waiting on bleeding edge CSS features: Recent years have seen significant advancements in browser CSS capabilities, such as Container Queries, `:has()`, and Subgrid. While these features can enhance the design and functionality of a website, they can be difficult to implement using Tailwind. In some cases, it may be necessary to wait for them to become available in Tailwind or make changes to the implementation once they are supported.\\n- Native is forever: When incorporating a new framework like Tailwind into a project, it will require a learning phase. However, it's important to note that the knowledge acquired is specific to the Tailwind framework, including its class names and naming conventions, which may not be transferable to other frameworks. On the other hand, using CSS in its native form and understanding its intended use will result in a knowledge that will remain useful for a long time.\\n- Bare-bones by default: What makes Tailwind different to other frameworks like Bootstrap etc is that you will need to create basic components like footers and headers from scratch, unless you pay for TailwindUI. These prebuilt components are not freely available as open source. Instead most build there own components from scratch using the Tailwind CSS classes.\\n\\nTailwind can be a suitable choice for almost any team, especially those that have no strong lead in CSS. Although it has some drawbacks, it sits between Bootstrap and native CSS in terms of flexibility and appearance. It avoids the common \\\"look and feel\\\" of websites built with Bootstrap, while providing some rails to prevent a large messy CSS file.

Otherwise, it prints the number itself.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"startCharIdx\":2,\"endCharIdx\":920,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"TLHOarN29b8UM+RMd/D5lLptPwSfBI2+g5Iu7IRH8JU=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"d8902c02-3650-4189-8422-d0073e89b30c":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"d8902c02-3650-4189-8422-d0073e89b30c\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/ai-assisted-coding-tools-codellama-vs-github-copilot-chat.md\",\"file_name\":\"ai-assisted-coding-tools-codellama-vs-github-copilot-chat.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/ai-assisted-coding-tools-codellama-vs-github-copilot-chat.md_11\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/ai-assisted-coding-tools-codellama-vs-github-copilot-chat.md\",\"file_name\":\"ai-assisted-coding-tools-codellama-vs-github-copilot-chat.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"/ij/OpBfTn1rUSXKZdgHwEJkfOJUb0LkdYIWgrohZLU=\"}},\"text\":\"### Comparison 2 - Largest and Smallest Number in an Array 1-100\\n\\nAgain another classic coding challenge question.\\n\\n`How do you find the largest and smallest number in an array of 1-100 in JavaScript?`\\n\\n| Assistant               | Time to content | Rating |\\n| ----------------------- | --------------- | ------ |\\n| GitHub Copilot (GC)     | -               | 0/5    |\\n| Continue/CodeLlama (CL) | 10s             | 5/5    |\\n| GitHub Copilot (GC)     | 5s              | 4/5    |\\n\\nWith GC I got off to a very rocky start.

This time CL took an age to return a result in comparison to GC. The result from CL was pretty poor in terms of being able to use right away. As a teaching tool it was helpful in explaining how you could test a JavaScript function detailing the install steps required to set up testing. But it embedded HTML encoded characters, meaning it could not be used right away. GC on the other hand returned some tests that could be used immediately, but the tests it did return were wrong for the context of the function. Three tests only worked if you had supplied a number to the function to test the results, it hadn't taken the context of the function we provided in to consideration (even though GC is supposed to be able to read the open files in VS Code).

`eleventy.config.js` to `eleventy.config.mjs`.Installed the helper plugin by running:\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm install @11ty/eleventy-upgrade-help@3\\n```\\n\\nAdded the upgrade plugin to the `eleventy.config.mjs` file.Commit here\\n\\n```js\\nimport UpgradeHelper from \\\"@11ty/eleventy-upgrade-help\\\";\\n\\n// Added the upgrade helper plugin  inside the default function\\neleventyConfig.addPlugin(UpgradeHelper);\\n```\\n\\nAsked GitHub Copilot to \\\"Update to esm syntax\\\" and made sure the `eleventy.config.mjs` file was referenced in the chat.That converted all my `require` statements into `import` statements.See the difference here between my previous v2 config to my v3 config.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"5JJ+ooBjTNfGValpcyOwg/+kGcHJRzXhUiA86HF4Hkc=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"d54101b6-7a57-44e1-b2f2-6b7aa9f5f13d":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"d54101b6-7a57-44e1-b2f2-6b7aa9f5f13d\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/another-easy-eleventy-upgrade.md\",\"file_name\":\"another-easy-eleventy-upgrade.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/another-easy-eleventy-upgrade.md_1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/another-easy-eleventy-upgrade.md\",\"file_name\":\"another-easy-eleventy-upgrade.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"0m5UuZ4S/qazM+QqBb8CWBF2Oc+EphqRQtvyBpEQ4Tg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"88a239ef-c3a9-49d9-86e5-282b37392394\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/another-easy-eleventy-upgrade.md\",\"file_name\":\"another-easy-eleventy-upgrade.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"5JJ+ooBjTNfGValpcyOwg/+kGcHJRzXhUiA86HF4Hkc=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"3cabcefe-ff4a-468c-b6af-f75edaf227d9\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"B6zS46jsyWguvo3LInCueI7eI/A00zu7vDYAcVTRg9g=\"}},\"text\":\"See

worked as expected.I removed the upgrade helper plugin and did a little tidy up switching syntax from commonjs to esm (es6/es2015) and pushed the branch to test the preview build (got to love Netlify's setup).The preview build looked good too, so I merged it into main.All done and dusted in under an

course, open to suggestions, not the VLN handle.This is just one way to do it.So let's just jump into it, I think.So today's stream is going to be working on the design of a database.So not actually building it as such in any code or anything like that.going to use a tool called DB diagram and we're going to use that to help us design the database that we're going to put together for our LMS and we have a super base.Okay let's jump straight into that.So they're going to be pretty much sitting in Chrome for this whole demo.And I've gone here to DB diagram right here.So you can use this so free tool.I've used this many times in the past.I'm sure many of my past students remember going through using this.But it basically allows you to draw entity relationship diagrams in a nice little web tool and we'll just start getting into it I think.So let's sort of think back and sort of cast our minds back to what we've done previously.So we have created a table for Superbase and it's sitting here in the Table Editor and we've got a courses table.OK, so this is basically a table that we started last stream, which was about two weeks ago now.And in it we have a name and a description and an image for the course.and we can ID.So we can use that as one of the part of the design that we're going to be working on.So let's jump straight to DPDiagram and sort of get our heads in the game about how we're going to design this database.Okay so it's got a pretty simple format, you log in, you can use github login which is handy of course not having to create another account again and it's got like a basic demo here and it's talking about a product category and a product image and it's a nice sort of starting block there and it shows sort of the relationship here between these three tables So these are not the tables that we're going to use, but this is a good place to start so that we can sort of see how the tool works.So the tool is very much a.it's a representation of the database's tables and those relationships between them.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"ckoRY/hITvm/EQYHbYRwrz2zTbiSNT0i/+VXWtOg860=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"628b2f92-e821-4580-9e55-13856559b7ad":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"628b2f92-e821-4580-9e55-13856559b7ad\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md\",\"file_name\":\"build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md_1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md\",\"file_name\":\"build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"jnJ2q0H0+RgGMqKC2g5AgQ0bDI5Re5jRZz3BMHtwSC8=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"baff6661-525a-4a17-b1ec-e95cb185f1b8\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md\",\"file_name\":\"build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"5my0L8r2SdJR4iGrLp+az3uPetbRLp61GjTUlWuTNeI=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"77950654-2966-47d3-be54-0670321d564e\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"vKIZDNkaSht+vvTJW7WZDLe1rcArcVQGjTkYFV12R/g=\"}},\"text\":\"it's a representation of the database's tables and those relationships between them.It has the keys, it has the IDs, it has the different types of the data restorative and it's all represented in a nice clean easy to sort of follow tool.So let's clear this out so that we're starting from scratch.Okay so once I do that it's now got no tables in there.Okay and so we've got the courses table which is what I was showing before.So we can have a table, you don't need to know so much the syntax for this, it does have a bit of help here in the documentation.but you can get along pretty far just by sort of following the examples.Okay so give it a table name.So this isn't SQL as such, it's just a language that's used for the dp-diagram.io.I'm trying to remember what it is off the top of my head.I think it's DBML.Yes, DBML is a syntax for defining a database.So, Open Source Markout Language User Defined Database Schema Structure.DBML is also developed by the team behind DB diagram.So, all the help's in here.It's got the actual outline there of a basic table structure and how to do this relationship of some of the next page there.So let's go back to our diagram.So we've got a table, we've got courses.Next one I was showing before in the UI for Superbase.Again it's a very sort of simple sort of markup kind of language.So you've got the table name using a plural there for courses.And I need to have an ID.So I'm going to have a course ID.This is going to be a integer.So let's make sure that we do that the correct way.So it's an integer like that, int.And we can have the primary key there.That's what the PK stands for.So if we go like that.OK, it's got a little key icon there for the cross ID.So that's very much like what we've got for our existing table here.So the next field in there is a created at.Again, created it and this is going to be a timestamp.I believe that's the right

believe that's the right type.So timestamp, whenever a row is added to this table, it's going to get the timestamp placed on it and so that we know when that record was actually created.Okay so we then got back to let's have a double check again we've got the name of archer and the description a text okay so again name so this is the name of the course.Name is a reserved word you can use use that word in this context so I could actually just just change it to a course name.That actually might be a better descriptive name of it and it's gonna stop any sort of confusion there.We're gonna know when it's a name and it says course_name that it is of the course table.And we can give it a varchar like so.Okay so we've got the course ID created at course name and the Vacha.I'm gonna have a description.Okay so this is description for our course.Okay I'm gonna use the text type here because I expect this to be more like a paragraph of content.With Vacha it's I guess more for a limited name.Ideally, it's sort of, our child will probably store less bytes in their records.Not that that's such a big issue these days in the past.That is something that people would stress about because, wow, RAM was expensive and so was this space.So thankfully, that has changed from there.And so we can have a image as well and this is going to be a VARCHA and it's going to point to some sort of hosting that we will talk about at a latest point.But for the time being it's just going to be a VARCHA.It could be an actual direct link to where the image is actually located.Okay, all right so that's going to have our ID for the course, the created app, course name, description and the image there.Okay, so we've got one table and that courses table, I mean it's a key part of our LMS.You need to have a course to be able to learn from, So it's really important that we have this table as part of our MVP.So let's continue

let's continue on.I know we need, with anything with a course, you could have maybe a course section.So you've got the course itself but you need the actual content for each part of it.So what we can

we can do the most important part about it is that we can have a relationship there for the courses to the courses section.So we can have the course ID as an int.And we're also going to need, I guess, something to go into our courses section.So we'll have-- what we could really have.So a section could be maybe it's some text, it could be just a sort of a free-form text area.So we could have section itself and the content.OK, so say I see like a section would be like a page in the course.So we can give it a title.Title would probably be good.Something like that.Vacher will have the course itself and we'll have a section of where it is and we'll also need probably something they probably haven't thought about is something like an order.So we're going to have the order for the section.So what do I mean by that?So imagine you've got a book and the book would be a course and in that course you'd have the book and it would have in it it would have pages and each page could have like a title, it could have the order so like which page it's on so this could be the order so one to you know 100, 150, 300 whatever how many pages your course is going to be.So by having an order there we can shuffle stuff around if we want want to at a later date, which is going to be handy for people administrating the course.So they're going to need to have some way of being able to order that section.So imagine we've got the courses page.They're going to have a landing page for that course.They go into the course.They go to the first

there, then we should be fine.Okay, so I've got the Media ID, Section ID, and then I'm going to have an image.Okay.And.I'm actually not going to do that.I'm going to do the actual section content.So this will be the content.I'm just going to have it as a text area.Thinking I'm going to use sort of markdown for this, but I'm still in the early stages of planning out the app.And that's OK.We can change it later.This is the first part of our planning.We don't have to get too caught up on the details too far yet.OK.So you can auto-arrange that, so just that, oh, I've got them in the middle there.That auto-arrange, all the tables there for us.So it's starting to get that sort of visual look and feel so we can actually start getting an idea of how this is actually going to work for us.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"CyxSMljkJ46SrrPgvTzm67GA6iUy3nUzfUsnTCMAh7s=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"5b0e78a7-5b76-4d17-a5e9-9705dde2ccdd":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"5b0e78a7-5b76-4d17-a5e9-9705dde2ccdd\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md\",\"file_name\":\"build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md_1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md\",\"file_name\":\"build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"jnJ2q0H0+RgGMqKC2g5AgQ0bDI5Re5jRZz3BMHtwSC8=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"2f9c4dde-64fe-43fe-abdc-73027a6d8364\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md\",\"file_name\":\"build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"a+ncw3/w8GUfcXXLWV38FGdIc2sMxqC7727VtoT+iHE=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"62292c09-b9e6-4a06-91a8-3a23216e9232\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"5nz5m/nSaENv+A+Rxk21BQd77DYMbZE4WROmm5cTmcQ=\"}},\"text\":\"OK, so we've got the courses, the courses section, the courses media.also going to need some comments I believe.So what we can do is we can have that again another table and we can have our courses.This is going to be the comments table.Okay, so we've got this courses comments.We need to link, we're going to link the comments to the media, and the media is going to be linked to the section, and the section is going to be linked to the course row.Okay, so we've got the courses comments.So I'm going to have 'comment ID', again, another primary key, like so.And we are going to have the student.So I'm going to put the student ID in.And I'm going to put the comment itself.Okay, so we're going to do a basic structure here now for our courses.We talked about that we want students to be able to enroll into these courses.So we need to also probably have some way of recording how that's done.There's a couple of different ways we can do that.We'll come back to that because I think it's probably important now that we start showing some of these relationships between these four tables so that we get an understanding of how this data is all going to be tied together.And this is the biggest reason why we use the entity relationship diagram.It just makes it easier for us to understand what the relationships are between the different tables there.It's got a really basic sort of structure here.So you've actually got two ways to do this according to the docs here.So you can do your relationship like so with the ref there pointing to the other table.Or you can use for the likes of a many to one relationship.you can do the same of having it in line instead and you can see here it's very similar syntax, it's just that it's got a square brackets around that.Okay so let's grab this one, we don't really need the first part of it but basically we have, we're going to have a very much a one-to-many.So let's think about this.Let's look at this diagram and get a sort of head around this.So it's saying we've got a many-to-one

it's saying we've got a many-to-one relationship.Okay so in the code here it's got a reference here, many-to-one like so.Okay so we could have the same.So we could have our course ID like so.And so there's a couple of two different ways that you can see that I've done this.So now it's representing that sort of link between the two.So I've just dragged between one to the other.It's around the wrong way.I'm going to do.So I'm going to have many sections for many Ds.So I'm going to go the other way there.So it better, you can see there when I highlight it, you know, it shows one and the star, star being many, so one to many.So I've got one course ID, it's going to have many sections.So the course ID here, this is not going to be a primary key, there's going to be multiple versions that will be same course ID for all the different sort of pages that we're going to have on our course.Okay so let's have a look at that.So we've got courses, we've got the courses linking from to the section.We now need the.again same sort of thing.So you can drag and drop that and we'll do those lines for you.You could write this up, anyway there's nothing stopping you from doing that kind of beauty of this tool is that you know you've got a GUI for when you want to use it and you've also got a quite nice markup language that's easy to share.Another good thing about this having it be all sort of a markup language that's not specific you can actually this is this is independent of database it is.So in the case of our project we are using Superbase which is basically a hosted Postgres database.So we can make it export this to some Postgres SQL or flavor of Postgres SQL but this dbml language is actually to the database agnostic so we could maybe even export the same thing for the links of MySQL or Microsoft SQL as well I believe.Okay so we've got the courses, I've got the courses section, courses media and we're gonna have the comment ID.What did I

and then we are going to then link that MediaID from here to there.Like that, cool and so if we auto-arrange it, I'll tidy that out nicely for us.Okay, so now we're starting to get that sort of structure there, so we can have you know one section can have many media items in it and of course a media item can have many comments against it.So the students would be able to you know maybe ask questions or they could maybe tag their instructor or just try and get some clarification or maybe put something in a way that they understand it better.So that way of course then the course in question is going to actually be make a lot more sense to a lot more people.Okay so we have the courses, course section, course media and the courses comments.You go a little bit of a little bit of play here, you can choose which colour your actual the theming I guess for the diagram is so we can do the same where we can Have a whole lot of the structure of tables here and that To me I guess the one of the key Tables that we're going to require There's one that's going to have the students information Okay, so students information again Something like that.We are going to need a student ID.Like so.Again, primary key.And we are going to have created it.I missed that on some of our other tables.Probably thinking why do you need to create it on all these tables?The good thing about a database is by having this extra metadata around it, not only do we have the information about what record was being added, knowing when is actually going to be helpful as well.So maybe we have an error log in our application and we could actually then draw back through the created at records there.So we might be able to see if there was an issue there with that table that could give us some

that, we've got auditing.So a big thing about a lot of apps and the like is it's very helpful to know when something happened or something was recorded.So having that created at timestamp with the

time zone if needed.So we've got students, student ID created at, we will also need I guess a big first thing that someone needs, a person or a human or a student, in this case is going to be their first name.And I'm going to give that a voucher.I can give my last name.Again voucher and I'm also going to give them a email because I need some sort of form of connecting their accounts and getting

ID here so we would expect there to be a link there between the student ID and the comment.Ok so they need to, we know then that this table now is linked via IDs here and why have we done it this way?Well the big thing that remember is with databases and the like, we try to make our data so that it can easily be updated or changed.It's common these days for people if they get married or in a civil union etc they may change their last name so it would be annoying if you had to repeat the first name and last name on all the comments so that when that user updates their details, then we'd have to go into multiple records there and I'll take those records if we were storing their first name and last name.But instead of course we're storing the student ID.So we're storing instead the link between this table and the other and that's it.Which means that if we do change, If they need to change their last name or first name or email address, they can do so and they are only going to

some way of tracking, I guess the progress of where our students granularity, we would I want to actually record where the student got up to.I could have it right down to the media itself, but I think that that's probably too low into the details.I'd probably be okay if we just did just track the progress of the student as maybe they got to page two or page three of the course.So the section is where I probably want my granularity at.So each student is going to need a progression.So what we can do for that is we can create a Students progress table, I think I think that's what we'll call it Table students progress Okay, so this is going to record like I said The student the course that they're on and what section that they are up to okay, so Good thing for this is we probably can get away with the one record per student per course and that way we should be fine in that regards to just track that.So we can do, so we've got the student ID, We're going to have the course section ID, so we're going to need what section ID that they're up to.And then after that, we're going to need to have a Hi there in the chat, I just noticed, sorry.And we're going to need to have, of course, the, we know what's last may be modified.I think that would be a good one to have and of course the course ID.I missed that out, that's pretty important.So again, this whole record is going to be made

we're going to have this sort of relationship here between.Move that out of the way, make it a little bit easier, see?Between the student there and their progress.Okay, so I'd see that their section ID would change as they traverse through the course.they go to the next page, we could then record the following section ID and then we could also update the modified at time stamps so that we keep in

has a great little tool here, so you've got the actual, you've got the table editor itself but you've also got the SQL editor.So if we open up that, now we've got a basically a free area where in a web app we can go and add our table.First thing we're going to do because I've made probably a few little changes, I think to my courses.I'm just going to actually just drop that table.That's okay.Dropping off the cascade there, so I can delete all that.I shouldn't have been in any cascade anyway because there's nothing linked between them but why not.Okay so like I said we exported the

a slightly different But it actually you know, it's still very easy to read SQL as one of those languages But isn't too far from English there It's not a big stretch To be able to easily follow Okay, so we've got the courses.We've got the courses section got the section ID the course ID the integer title Vacher order again media That's okay.Of course it's comments.Students and the students progress.If we follow down here, you can see where it's got the alter table and it's altering the table name.Adding a foreign key and so it's reference to that certain ID.Let's actually just go ahead and run that.That's all looking okay to me.Okay, cool.So now, we should have all our courses created.Cool.Okay, looks like there's warning there and we're going to enable some road level security.But you can see it's created that course as we had it in the SQL here.So we've got the id, we've created that, the course name, theta description, image again and we'll have the same again for all the different tables here.So this is a great way of being able to quickly sort of sketch out in a tool like this dvdiagram.io get the I guess the entities of the database how you would like to have them and yeah just be able to export them to some SQL that you can then run in a Postgres database or in our case run it on Superbase which is basically a hosted version of Postgres for us.Once that's done we should then have all the tables should have the foreign keys and the linking between them so that if say I had a course and I created a record here, it would expect in the courses section that that's going to be linked to that course ID.Okay, it has to be linked to our record there because we had it as part of our SQL here.Another great thing about this, now we've got some SQL that is available for us.I mean we can keep a copy of that.likely we can check that into our source

mean we can keep a copy of that.likely we can check that into our source control.So it could be used as sort of a manual migration which would mean that whenever we wanted to set up an environment like this, with the like surf base we can literally start a new account, start a new project and again be be able to replicate that whole structure again of our database structure.And what I could also do, probably next step would be to go and create some SQL to add some content there.The beauty of that, having it done by an SQL statement again is, you know, we can come back if we destroy the database, we break something on it, we can roll it back to a previous state, which is something we always want to be able to do with both our source code and our data.So that's again allow us to do that.But again like the DB diagram tool is you know such a great easy to use tool for something that's again I'm quite a visual person and I find it very much easier to sort of start getting that sort of laid out and a sort of visual representation that helps me think about the way that the data is going to be structured and how I can actually build out my database.Is this the VL and end all?Is it finished?No, it's not.I will probably change my ideas at later stages but it's you know at this point we're just trying to get sort of the MVP the most most valuable product I was like the one I like to call it again make that most valuable product and this is a great way to get started putting at your table structure having an individual way you know you've got a record of it both as some SQL and you could also export it as a PDF or SVG etc.\\n\\nSo you can embed it in your documentation and you've got that sort of structure there that's saved.I'll be able to come back to this.It makes these nice links here that so you can actually even share these in this tool.So you can see here I've got the share and I can share composite protector, can get invite people etc.\\n\\nwhich is pretty cool.And another thing that it also allows is we do have the history here so we can roll back in time to see and change

actual SQL that we used to create these tables.You can do the same or not.You can jump in and you can also manually make these.There's no right or wrong way.It's just a good way of being able to

the fifth video in the series and we're really only just getting to the point where we can start sort of actually thinking about doing the code itself.And that's the same with any project.Anything that has a lot of complications to it or anything like that, it's actually really important that you do a little bit of planning.Okay.So, we've got that there.Okay.So, in GitHub, you actually have some project management tools and they're tucked away in the project section here.And by default, there is nothing, no project created yet.But we can create a new project for this.Click on the

permutations of what's actually going to be required there.Sign up page, login page, forgot password, what else are we going to need?Anything else we can think of?Top of my head.I think that should be fine.We could make a new password.I should actually be calling these routes rather than pages.So that we can route the user where they are needed rather than.Okay, so we can edit the title.Yeah, forgot password route.So these are not the components themselves.This is what I'm thinking of in terms of the routing, in terms of the XJS.Because we need a way to get to the components that we're going to be seeing.And we need to be able to actually navigate that, of course, from a URL.And why do we do this?Well, there's a couple of good things.Why we actually set up all these routes and the like.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"/n78uZx2CqY0kvKgSoarKgl+HHDwSEV+Gxc9iF1uX/M=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"09e9f6fd-2128-4198-8cb2-0898fda88393":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"09e9f6fd-2128-4198-8cb2-0898fda88393\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md\",\"file_name\":\"build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md_1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md\",\"file_name\":\"build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"2on9OKUvm3ooQskFZF6FRgGdF4BOrnlAwIe+wT/lML0=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"f2bdc2f8-0def-47b3-b26d-93faad8a1f3d\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md\",\"file_name\":\"build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"UggHiM8X6KmMwFJm7f8mdIJwycUGydsGf7aPl4g0WdM=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"f7e96dbb-79a3-4489-a084-6b57fe66cd24\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"0ga8osFpnR27IMWfr5I/FdXrkQDYScgEhgHvh3AkbRs=\"}},\"text\":\"Why we actually set up all these routes and the like.So a good thing about any sort of website, it's a really good idea to think about all the routes in terms of your HTML is something that you can actually pass off to another application.The great thing about links is you can embed them in, say, a message, or you can embed them in an email.When a user clicks on those, the user would be redirected to that part on the website.And it's better than, I guess, having stage controlling all the different routes.Instead, we can use the URL, which is something that stays the same in this, in the actual sort of URL bar in a browser, and take advantage of that to hold our state of where the actual user has navigated to.And that's probably a key thing about websites is that they have this inbuilt state there, this really clever process of the URL.Very simplistic, but really powerful when you think about what you can do with a URL in terms of being able to direct someone to do something.We can look at the URL that we've got here for the GitHub project.And we can see it's got, of course, the domain to get to the site.The users, so it's got the Andrew James 4 there, that's my GitHub username.It's got projects, it's got a number 4, so that's obviously the project number 4 that's been created.And you've even got like a view there, it's got like an identifier of one, and it's actually even got some parameters there.So before we change some of these, we may actually, let's see what happens to our state.We should get some changes.Yeah, so now we don't see the actual issue itself.Once we click on it, we can see the issue, we can see the item ID.If I click on to some of these others, of course the ID changes.So very powerful, I think, a URL.It's probably something we don't think about a lot, but it's really important to think about it in terms of you'd be able to send someone an email to say, hey, you forgot your password.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"oVUL90HO0e9sOBly+cq0aoZk7NAWO7oclmWL12t4duM=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"f7e96dbb-79a3-4489-a084-6b57fe66cd24":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"f7e96dbb-79a3-4489-a084-6b57fe66cd24\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md\",\"file_name\":\"build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md_1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md\",\"file_name\":\"build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"2on9OKUvm3ooQskFZF6FRgGdF4BOrnlAwIe+wT/lML0=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"09e9f6fd-2128-4198-8cb2-0898fda88393\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md\",\"file_name\":\"build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"0HuGTAWI48tItY/iGaFTqAlXjz5rcXx3+0vZFfRkRBY=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"70b91fa5-32c0-40bd-ba0a-269d21e62ba9\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"gKrRQY836vWlA0kQfnhyrfQcIR6PqI9CEYBcaS1mni8=\"}},\"text\":\"So when you go for that whole process of a forgot password route, then we can actually get them to go to the direct form that they need to go to, maybe to reset that password.And it's all at all at really important parts of building web applications.Okay, so we've got a signup page, I've got a logon page route, I've got a forgot password route, I've got a new password route.So these are the actual routes themselves.So there's a little bit of boilerplates we need to do for that in terms of with the Next.js documentation.So previously we had, of course, the page folder, so you have the folder name.So you can have like a signup route folder name.And in that route, you could have the page.js file, which would actually be, I guess, the routing page to it.And then you could, of course, load components after that with the likes of React.Okay, so I've got these routes here, I've got the project.So we should be able to, let's quickly switch to that.Okay, you should be able to see the project itself.Okay, so this is my last sort of changes I did from last night around the ERD diagram.So I've got a link there to dbdiagram.io and the markdown file.And I've got a link to the extensions and a little bit of help here, where this is all located, a link to the playlist, etc.\\n\\nSo that's still being updated.The project's running at the moment, you can see I've got it running under a dev container for my project.So I've got a docker running and the actual project is running like so.Now let's go to the courses folder.So with this, I've got a page.js.And in here, I've got a basically the courses heading, some way of getting the data and putting that onto the page.So like again, talking about the routes there.So in the case of a sign up or sign out, we were

through from the links of the homepage, the signup page, login page, course overview, course detail.So, again, this is a component that we're going to use throughout the actual application.So, it's a

I just quickly chatted to to copilot there.It's going to make sort of the basics there of what I need for the project.And like so, I'm not sure I actually need to do that.I don't like this function

just a div for that.I want an actual semantic HTML tag for that.So I'm going to use the actual header tag and replace that div.And we've got the start of our here.Okay.Looks like I'm about to run out

requirements around authentication, data storage, roles and permissions were mapped out.Superbase was selected to provide authentication via LinkedIn/Google login as well as for it being a Postgres database.Next.js was chosen for its React framework and Radix UI was selected for accessible, customizable UI components to speed up development.ogimage: \\\"full-stack1.jpg\\\"\\n---\\n\\n{% figure

doing today?I am going to build a full stack app with Next.js.So I had a few ideas for projects, but something I guess that is kind of floating my boat is trying to build an LMS.And an LMS, a learning management system, can have things like videos, code tutorials, documents.There's a whole range of things.And what the cool thing about it is there are parts of the app that will need to be public, and there will be parts that will need to be private.You will also need some sort of login, and there will be some need for an admin of some sort as well.So it's quite a big wide ranging project, and I know I'm not going to be able to do it all in one hour.So it's going to be a constant stream of every couple of days I will try and chip away a little bit more in it.So it should be quite fun.And yeah, it should be exciting as well in terms of hopefully some of you may have used Next.js before, but this is version 13, I believe.A few things have changed since I've last used it.So I'll be learning a little bit as well as you guys.So that's all good.Cool.Okay.So before we even get started, I guess what am I going to do in terms of the actual planning stage I guess?That's probably one of the first steps.I'm going to jump to my screen.There you go.So sometimes best to when you're starting to think of ideas and how you're going to do something, it's best to sort of whiteboard it.This is about as close as I can get to a whiteboard on a stream.This is freeform.So let's chuck in, I guess, the title.What are we going to call it?Going to be a LMS on Next.JS.Let me know in the chat if anything is hard to read as well.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"YlvSgD6GInjBexKm61tXiDZ/7N1c2l1ZERTk3dASJ0M=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"7f114400-520b-40ca-99c1-5615fd53fb5c":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"7f114400-520b-40ca-99c1-5615fd53fb5c\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md\",\"file_name\":\"build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md_1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md\",\"file_name\":\"build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"nA932ceikxqVCY7wwWNnA8IuLLo0k7/NuwR6fFCqr0E=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"1fe7ddaf-cc88-47d7-a4f4-e165dff1d5d8\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md\",\"file_name\":\"build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"bMnMUuIdV5ujJzpgFuARLoKW/fshgBZIIfy/qL3dI8E=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"19a9ff52-f9ae-46c4-be77-db6911e14c4c\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"b7Kow0Ygpn4066E0m1me3yya1XYW8/yJ3035CeHhifE=\"}},\"text\":\"JS.Let me know in the chat if anything is hard to read as well.Because I want everyone to be able to see it.Cool.Okay, so a couple of things that we're going to need for an LMS.We're of course going to need the project so that's a given.But we're actually going to need like a couple of things in terms of planning and that sort of things.So let's put some of those together.We could have, I notice a circle here.Okay.Bring it to the front.Okay and we're going to need probably some wireframes.That's probably a good place to start.We're going to need some way of storing the actual data that's going to be part of the LMS.So let's do that.So we want to determine how we store data.Okay, um big thing, colour theme, really important.We'll need that, colour theme.Okay.I guess Sort of be like I talked about before there will need to be some parts of it that are sort of sitting in the public and that can be indexed by Google and so we'll need public pages.This is just my big sort of my map of kind of how I'm gonna build it all.What else do we need we're gonna have logged in pages.Okay As soon as we say that we need to be logged in in some way We then we need to actually you know think about it in terms of what are we gonna use for authentication?What's it gonna be?What's the scope that can be made up of?Do we build?Do we use something that's off the shelf?It's tricky.Okay.What else do we need?Anyone else?So many ideas.The chat.Do you think the communication we've got that some sort of data store?We might need some sort of how the videos are managed.So media.How will that be handled?I guess what else do I want to have in it?What would be another good thing?I guess with a lot of LMSs you're going to need some authentication.You might need different types of permissions.So we're going to need some way to manage roles.So I could see there could be different types of

I could see there could be different types of users.So you could be someone-- maybe a student could be one type of role, and another role could be an admin or a course content editor that could be in different roles we'd need.Let's do that.So what am I going to do for student?I might just call it content editor.Make it very generic.What else could we have?We've got public pages.We've got logged in pages.We've got authentication.We've got our roles.Students, content editor, it's a way to have some data stored, how we're gonna handle media.A tutor for marking, yeah there could be another role with that a great one.What would that be?What would be a good name?So it could be just Marker, I guess.We'll keep it generic.We can always change these later, of course.Okay.What How sort of people like to see in LMS?How would the students maybe question something or how could they raise any issues?Any ideas?No.I'm thinking maybe they could have comments, so they could actually like comment on the video to make it, I guess, a bit more interactive there with people that are administrating the course.Plenty of LMSs of use in the past that they have some sort of comment system they could have a forum page.Oh, we're starting to get feature group ready aren't we?That's all good.Well I think that the tricky part is in anything when you're doing this is the scoping is you know basically fine tuning it down to what are things that you need to get started and we'll go after that.But I think pretty much a comments thing would be easy to, well a basic comment because this I've got to be careful with it.Non-threaded comments would probably be fine, maybe on each sort of page that could work.What else?I've got Marker, I've got a Content Interact of Student, Communication.Cool thing about authentication is it could be done in a couple of ways.So in my head I'm thinking you could have just a traditional sort of email password, which is fine, absolutely, some people love

we could also use a single sign-on, say like, authenticating with Google or LinkedIn, any of those sort of single sign-ons apps, that would be pretty good to be able to do that.So I'll just leave it pretty blank at the moment, single sign on sounds like a good one.Probably leaning towards I guess a bit more professional LinkedIn maybe, which means that we could maybe do some cool sort of badges or something like that when they've finished a course or something like that.But yeah that's something to think about in the future.Yeah so we can have these.I think this is like probably the minimum I think that I'd like to launch with.Yeah, it's looking pretty cool.Okay.I guess the tricky one I've kind of left off.Come to it later I think after the wireframes.This choosing maybe you know build a UI library from scratch or use something that's already pre-tested and available already.It's those cons and pros of trying to do all this stuff.Cool okay I'm just start now so now I've got sort of some brainstorming I guess of what I plan to do save it for starters I'll rename it, there we go RMS brainstorm cool Sorry there.Wireframes.I think that's where I'm gonna start.going to help get that visual sort of idea of what I want to do for my design there.I'm going to keep it pretty simple.I'm going to use something else.I could use this but I think I'll jump to Excalidraw just because it's nice and simple.I always forget how you create a new one.Reset the canvas, that's one.Cool.Alright, okay cool.So well, for starters this is going to be a responsive web app.So I'm going to build it with a mind that I'm going to have sort of mobile sized screens and tablets and of course desktops.Make that look a bit narrower.Let's do that for a tablet.And of course the desktop.Cool.Any design

I'm just going to put something like this here.Again these can be as rough as you want.Sometimes having it low fidelity is great because it means that you're just going to not be limited kind of what going to be doing.So that could be my nav up there.Let's do, that's my logo for now.And some sort of navigation.I just put a text label for now.I don't know if I put it as an icon or what.Comic Sans.Okay, that's the one thing I don't like about.There we go, about a Excalidraw.Okay, here.Of course this is gonna have a bit more room for menu items.Okay awesome.Okay so I've got you know basic navigation logos sort of here area it's gonna be consistent across the different sized screens there but I'm gonna have to actually make up a whole of different pages.So I'm just gonna put a label beside this this is gonna be it's gonna be the home.That's the kind of landing page that's gonna be a page that I want people to come to and be able to know sort of what they're coming to a site about, what's it going to try and get them to sign up, get them to see what's on offer and be able to do a course.So what I could do is I'd have some sort of maybe hero image here which would then entice people to want to be able to take a look.So I'm just going to do like a common thing is images is of course to have a cross-line for it to denote an image and have some sort of call to action, maybe call to action button or something like that that's going to get people to sign up Just keep it really rough.Ok, so that's on a mobile screen, front and centre, right in that first section as

bit more room to breathe.Potential here to have a nice hero image.What are the benefits, features or something like that.Could be as an image or it could be as text.Not quite sure yet.Cool.Okay.Sign up.That's done.Of course when you have a sign up you're also going to need some sort of login.I want to have this, the reason I've just not haven't done a lot on the sign up process is I don't want actually too much of a barrier there to get them first in the door.Ideally as being a, I guess, a potential student user, try to collect the minimum amount of information as possible.So maybe email, password, I can take them to a profile page later and they can fill in those kind of details.So I'll just try and keep it super simple and the other cool thing about this is if I have it very simple like this I can actually reuse it.I can use this for my login as well.Sometimes we want to take some shortcuts.Again this is a MVP but I'm trying to build.It's not gonna be all singing and dancing yet

can get away with.Yep.Okay, cool.So I need something that's going to be able to do authentication and database.There could be two different things.I could use two different services.I could have a Docker image running Postgres and I could use potentially something like Octa for sort of authentication there.Octa or Off Zero, having its little baby brother.Alternatively, there's one thing that's coming to my mind that could do both.And actually also hopefully save us some time.How do you know these things?This is the hard part, is basically you don't unless you've been searching out there for this kind of stuff.It's like how would you know what to even search for?But you could just like 4-0 of course.4-0 is basically your identification platform.So it's got the ability there to do all the, just like we want there, email password and continue with either sort of like Google or Office or like I've talked about LinkedIn as well.There's definitely something I could do.And on the database side, I could just use Postgres database.I could use maybe You can see here there's Amazon advertising there on that sponsored link for having a SQL Postgres database that's hosted on Amazon and it's a database as a service.Again, got the actual Postgres site.I know of another thing that would be quite beneficial.And that would be Superbase.So what I try to think about is, Firebase would probably be more similar to something like Mongo and it allows you to have a communication system, data structure and even things like being able to have storage on that side of things.So, media.We can do the

storage so we could store things like videos and images.That probably suits us nicely.Okay, cool.So I think we've made some decisions around that that we could, you know, we've got the ability there to do our authentication.So let's double check to make sure that we're going to be able to do some sort of single sign-on to have LinkedIn.How can I find that out?Good question.Let's go into the documentation.Enterprise, single sign on, social login.Yes, okay so we've got LinkedIn, we've got Google, we've got Microsoft, whereas you're using Slack, which actually, that could be quite a good one too.Awesome.Awesome okay so those that's all great that's social login that's going to be perfect we've got the ability to do logon with email again that's looking perfect for what we need maybe we've got a quick start there for next so we'll probably jump into this soon probably not today And what else do we need?We needed to look at it in terms of database.So I know that for a fact that Superbase actually also has a quite nice editing tool that's all web-based as well.So you can administer your site I guess while you're in that sort of early stages before you have I guess a full-blown actual interface there that people would be able to manage content in.Like I said in the whiteboarding here, let's try and keep it down to the minimum here.We want to try and get this out on launch so try to minimize your scope is a good way of doing that.Okay, alright so I'm feeling pretty happy about that.I think Superbase seems to be covering quite a few of my options.Communication,

like it's social auth providers.So we've got, it's quite generous I think that 500 megs, that should be fine.Probably not so much on the file storage at 1 gig, the video's big, but you can start off there at least and get going.And you can have 50,000 monthly active users.I wish I could have 50,000 monthly active users.It's more than could expect.So that's probably good in terms of getting up and running fast.Next on the list.How's it gonna look?This is a tricky one.I could of course go and make a full custom CSS theme layout that's probably going to be quite slow to get started.It'll take me quite a long time to build our component library and it's actually really hard to beat something that's already pre-configured.So even if you think about Tailwind even, you know, in terms of development speed, it's still going to make you a little bit faster there because you're not sort of starting from scratch completely.But I'll probably take it one step further again while I'll be able to have a lot of freedom in terms of customisation with something like Tailwind.I'll show you what I mean by that.There's actually another article, there's a couple articles about Tailwind on my own website as well.If you want to have a look Tail and what is Tail in CSS?So I've got a brief introduction about what it's all about.Well worth checking out if you would like to see that.Let's check it into the chat.Okay, it's great.I mean like I have used T quite a few times in the past, but it ends up meaning instead of having to write all our CSS out like this, we end up with

the CSS classes are already pre-configured and we just apply them to our components and react.Not bad, it's gonna be quite quick but it's still gonna require us to make all the sort of controls, form elements, things like because we're gonna need a login form so we're gonna need some sort of password field, input field.We'll probably need some nice text area of some sort to be able to do a comments for the users to be able to add comments.We're gonna need buttons of some sort, whether that be to enroll in a course or sign up on a form or that kind of thing.Navigation, that's another thing we probably want to have.We build that from scratch.It's not far wrong with doing that.Just time, time is our enemy I guess.When you're building anything from this for yourself, there's only sort of one person, so you can only, you know, you want to sort of maximize your time being able to build things a bit faster.And I could use a whole range of sort of UI libraries.There's MUI which is the material UI which uses React components.There's Chakra, Ant Design.There's just a couple off top my head.There's a version of Bootstrap that's built with React components.But a new one that I've really liked the look of and again the other great thing about it is that it prioritizes accessibility.It's the Radix UI.So why would I want to use something like this?Well you can see just from the sort of layout here if you look at the like playgrounds you know you've got a whole lot of input controls, you've got switches, you've got cards, you've got you know drop down components that kind of thing, nice little icons, what else, okay even like slider controls, not sure how to use that one but yeah there's even like a little play button there, might be something like that of course for our videos.So it's quite a well-designed sort of theme I guess.It's got the ability there to sort of have some customization where you can switch it already from light to dark.It's got the ability for

nice.Umm, cheap boxes.Code even.That's good.A menu.That's pretty slick.So you've got some awesome sort of ability to do a lot of this stuff out of the box without having to build it from scratch.Another cool thing about this Radix library, I believe it's got really good accessibility.So that's another, again, another thing that's going to also speed up time and sort of development.You know, trying to make your website accessible is a really important part of building anything these days.They say that somewhere between 5 and 20% of people have some sort of disability of some sort.And that's pretty big numbers and that can be ranging from everything from cognitive So maybe ADHD could be low sight, so there's a lot of macular deterioration of where people cannot see things that's easily in the centre of their vision.Colour blindness, there's all sorts.And it's really nice to be able to have something that's already got a lot of that done for you.So again, this theme's got icons, it's got quite a large big icon set, it's got colours, you know, you can use these colour schemes, and it's also got, these are primitives as well, so you've also got the ability there to I guess make some custom elements if need which is quite nice.Which is cool.Documentation wise, accessibility there, it's very much on the top level there.Again, I've got accessible labels, keyboard navigation, focus management, it's all built on there, keyboard navigation is there.So that's a great in terms of being able to build this web app.So going back to our whiteboard, we've got I guess a

familiar with it.It's React and it's very popular.It's got the ability to also do server-side rendering and client-side rendering, which is going to be of course important for things like public pages

worry about later.I guess the one other cool thing is the videos.It's storage media.We'll put Superbase down for the time being.I'm not sure if it's going to be cost effective in that area but we can sort that out.But there you've got a full stack app that will be built with Thanks.js, so we'll be able to build APIs or interfacing with Superbase anyway.We'll be able to render things server-side and client-side.The key thing about the client-side side of things is that we want to be able to track things like people's progress and eventually have some sort of interaction or some core sort whether that be you know questionnaires surveys that kind of thing so again it's leaning towards a a view library like React or Angular or View so that's kind of where we're looking at in terms of

2023 on Building a Full-Stack web app with Next.js.This is part 7 of the series.I am continuing a project with an LMS (Learning Management System) using the Storybook.js, Superbase, and Radix UI.So far, I have set up a header component and am working on building other components in isolation using the storybook.The LMS project is in its early stages with a homepage set up and another page for listing data.The Superbase database is connected, with a few tables for courses and students.The next step is to work with Radix components.The project is available on GitHub as LMS NextJS.Check out the documentation on Radix UI components for more information.youtube.com/embed/EXvU7F1D59o?si=8kM1Zl-k5_MIjtDG\\n\\n---\\n\\nAll right, hi there.I'm back.It's been a while, I know.So I'm going to be back continuing this project with our LMS using the storybook.js, Superbase, and Radix UI.So just to recap of where we got to, we have a component here.Okay, so we got our header component.Basically, that's all we've got set up at the moment in our project.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"D0mc0U2U3XcG8iVs6OnrFRlpJFKRMfq8N6ec8J68swg=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"26227edb-58bb-4c4c-99f5-d6d59989437f":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"26227edb-58bb-4c4c-99f5-d6d59989437f\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-radix-components.md\",\"file_name\":\"build-a-full-stack-next-js-radix-components.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-radix-components.md_1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-radix-components.md\",\"file_name\":\"build-a-full-stack-next-js-radix-components.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"RycDJePmIwRRaNnyaBiYuecwcm5C1KzVylY+ylhed2A=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"bc2f1b27-681b-4a61-89f3-9b30a58a984c\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-radix-components.md\",\"file_name\":\"build-a-full-stack-next-js-radix-components.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"D0mc0U2U3XcG8iVs6OnrFRlpJFKRMfq8N6ec8J68swg=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"373f9315-aca9-43f9-8ebc-3c6dfef52a43\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"IM8S1pLsZDNrXIJ5gZlp0jZglMeAE3Srfoo6qpnKOVY=\"}},\"text\":\"Basically, that's all we've got set up at the moment in our project.We're trying to build our components in isolation using the storybook.And in storybook, we will flesh out all our components that we can use, but in that sort of the layout, the stuff that's going to be reused as much as possible.So that includes things like the buttons, the header, photo, et cetera, that kind of stuff.Nothing that's real, I guess, layout specific.Okay, so what have we done so far with the LMS?Not a lot.We've got a homepage.I think we've got one other page where we're listing out some data.We've got Superbase connected up to it.We've got a couple of tables.We've got courses.We've got students and some supplementary tables around those too.Okay, so if you haven't been keeping up, might pay to have a look at the project.I'm just going to paste that into the chat.Okay, so that should come up shortly.And if not, it should be part of the description as well.What I'm going to do next is try and get some of these Radix components, wrap them in our own layers so that we can manipulate them how we would like to use them, and try and get those set up and ready.So let's jump into Chrome and I can show you that.Okay, so that's the project there.We've got the LMS, just the actual dev environment there, localhost 3000.So not much to see there.We've got some next one component that I'm going to make.I'm going to make a button and I'm going to give it the options to have a icon as well.So I'll set that up shortly.We've got our wireframes.So we've got our homepage there, sign up, course overview, course detail.Okay, so that's all we've got so far.We've got a storybook and we've got Superbase.Cool, okay.Let's get started.We'll start off with this button.Easy way to get started is I'm literally going to copy this example code and I'm going to place that into our

up.Awesome, and we'll import the icons as well.Actually we won't.We want to make that a property that we can add to the component so that the person using that component can easily style as necessary.Okay, we're going to make this a button.I'm just going to prefix all my components so it's obvious which ones are pre-built and which ones are my own.And I'm going to move this up until I return there.Okay.Return like that.What help if I may have used the right brackets there?Okay, so I'm going to drop out this component here.Now we'll make that an input.So this could be the icon.So we're going to need a title and an icon like so.Okay, so it's super basic.We're taking a title and we're taking the icon.Icon can be provided, which is awesome.We need to actually have a story for that so that we can actually display that.So I'm going to grab the header one to get started.There's a boilerplate.Just remember I've got my alien mess button in front of it.I don't know what I've done wrong already.I did not name this correctly.Okay.Keep forgetting it's the other way around.So that's the component itself.There is this is the name that's going to be there and the both the URL

this wrapped in some braces?That's where I went wrong.Okay, so back on Chrome.We can see I've got a button there.It's got my title at the moment.So I can actually add some parameters to this in a sec.You can see that there is a button.It's not very looking very nice.We need to install the providers here for the UI.Okay, so we've got the button there.We've got the title.And our default

you're showing the code, what do we see there?We've got the elements button and we've got a title.So we can update this on the fly.This is the real reason we want to use something like Storybook.Because we can do this as we change it.Then we get that sort of real time view there.So we get that actually looking like it's supposed to.Okay.Next steps.Okay, so we've got that working.It seems I've got some problems with my audio here.No, it's not tweaking.Sorry.I had the mic.I had an off screen so I couldn't see that.Bump that up so I can see really important.Be able to hear me.Okay,

can actually have a look to see if they're using storybook and the project or Radix.That might be able to help us.So you've got a playground here.So that just wraps that there.Okay, so the

with the idea here.Go to the alternative.This is not yarn.Okay, so let's edit that to our storybook.Now we need to go and update.So we've added that we've got once installed, open your storybook main.js file and add the storybook.Add the storybook add on styling and the add owns array.Got stories.Let's open up our code again.Now we're set the configuration file.Some dots to report mean.Okay,

global styles are defined in CSS files, you can import your style sheets in the storybook preview.js file.Storybook load any files imported here on every story render.That sounds like us.So let's look

could add some HTML around it but that's actually not really going to help us.We want to be able to add the JavaScript theme component just like we do for the standard page and I'd like to do it at the top level rather than have to do it further down the chain in each storybook but it's looking like that's not going to be an easy thing to do.So what can we do instead?Now we can't have with this default here any parameters around it but let's have a look.So this is the default in the story that's just the arguments.Ah!Args can modify any aspect of your component.You can use Args in your stories to configure the component's appearance similar to what you do in an application.For example here's how you could use a photo argument to populate a child component.This is going to import the page, have it as a child.Okay this could actually be what we want.The only downside is this is at that story level.So we do have that render function.Some components require a harnessed render and a use away.For instance if a component runs right up to its edges you might want to space it inside Storybook.Use a decorator to add spacing for all stories of the component.Okay so with that example.Apply story.Story to enable it.I'll take some locking.Okay so this is on preview.js.Back to where we started.Theme provided there, theme default.This is actually looking more like what we want.Let's try this again.Being a developer is probably 90% reading the documents.Especially if you're using open source projects.Just to be able to implement it in your own project.Okay so this is my

doesn't.So yeah, being able to do this kind of thing and just be determined.Show your grit.Work through your problems, try and get back to basics.Try and prove that something is or not working.That's how you can debug stuff.And it's not always the help you get is perfect.Sometimes you have to actually think about what is actually happening or what isn't happening and go through those sort of steps to actually try and figure out what is going wrong.Now, it isn't something that you learn in like two seconds, but it is something that you learn over a career.So what do you do if you have those issues?Sometimes you just keep at it.Sometimes you actually walk away from the keyboard because it's easier.I come back to it and I'm sure you'll solve the problem in your head.But otherwise, hopefully that was good.Have a great weekend.If you are watching this on the weekend, of course, this was livestream.Have a look at the other videos in the series so you can see the last one or storybook where I set that up.I'm going to continue.Try and be a more regular cadence so that people can watch these sort of weekly or fortnightly.And don't forget to please like and subscribe.That

session.And so I went through how I was going to plan the app, go through things like a wire framing.So we have a link for that here.And we've also got the mind map, which was here.Okay, so we've got

first article on the list at the moment.It's built with fullstack and NextJS, part one planning.So if you look at that, there is the link to the video, link to the wireframes, screenshot of the whiteboarding and there's a whole transcript there of the entire video.So if you want to quickly find something you can do so.Awesome!Okay, all right what are we going to do today?Today we are going to start setting up the initial parts of the app.Okay so I'm going to go through that whole process of installing the actual code on a local machine, setting it up in a GitHub repo, pushing that to public so that you guys can see it.And then I'm also going to try and start the part of actually building the app, start looking at the wireframe there and start getting that working.Okay cool okay so if we go to the docs for Next.js\\n\\nso on the Next.js org website forward slash docs there is a usually what's for pretty much every single website you can imagine these are getting started page and getting started page is generally what we want to look at in in terms of actually installing all the prerequisites there and actually get it up and running.So first of all, number one, you're going to need Node.js 16.14 or later and pretty wide range here.You've got macOS, Windows or Linux.Okay, I'm going to open up a terminal window.Let me see.OK.So in my developer directory I'm going to go into YouTube.Cool.OK, so I'm going to create a new project here.Again, we need to look at that MPX command.So let's grab that.Come back to terminal here and this is going to install the latest version of create next.So what is your project named?We're going to call it LMS next.js.OK, we're not going to use TypeScript.I'll do that another

going to set up the over code needed there for React, React-DOM, Next, DSLint, and Excellent Config Next.Funnily enough it says those things in the Installing Dependencies part there.So, okay, cool.Let's have a look at this directory now.If we go into the LMS folder, okay, cool.Think about it, it's already set up a Git repo folder there.I'm going to open up this folder now.So open full stop or period depending on where you live.So open there is going to open up the finder.Cool so we can see the actual files themselves.Cool and we can do code.fullstop and that is going to open up a nice vision of VS Code already pointing at that directory.Cool.Okay so I've got that up and running.You should be able to see that on the screen.What I'm going to do next is start talking about what other dependencies we needed.So going back to the whiteboard here.So I talked about the need to have Radix UI.So I was going to use that for my UI components.way I'm not building them from scratch sort of thing.Instead I can actually just worry about the other parts of the app rather than the actual UI components because I know that these components have been tested, they've got really good accessibility.Instead I can just focus on I guess the back end parts of the app and not have to worry too much about the front end.The other part that I'm going to need is of course Superbase and so we'll set that up as well.Okay so let's go to the Radix UI website.Okay again it's a nice big getting started button let's use that.Again, I'm going to copy that and I am going to open up the terminal window here.Okay.So while that's installing, let's go back and have a look at the getting started guide here.After that, I need to import the global CSS file at the root of your

part of the app is being built.You can see there that we have the HTML tags and of course the body there.So what I'm going to do is I'm going to import the style sheet.And then after that I am going to then go back to the docs help file and I'm going to do the import process here.So I'm going to import the theme.Okay, and then I'm going to wrap my app just like it has shown here in a theme component.And I can move it like so.Okay, cool.Body theme.Okay, I might actually do the same as what they have done.Probably pays to pay attention to what the instructions are doing.Okay and I've got an extra tag there.Cool.All right.Okay so we have the theme going now.If we actually run the application, let's see what happens.That's localhost 3000.Okay, so we're not seeing any sort of UI changes or anything like that.We've probably still got the initial stylings there from Next.js.Let's go with the Alumnares.Okay.Cool, so the title's changed so we know that something's happening and that's tab and we can start pulling apart I guess what's already in there.I'm just going to rip it all out to this global style sheet and probably not going to use that.Again it's starting to look very sparse and And if I do the same here, I'm going to have to be mindful of the fact that there's expecting those styles that are coming from that CSS module.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"MMeBqyT4X/Q/ajSXnkBBocpLgto336dLKZ2TBi9X/KA=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"840d8ed7-7960-4366-a194-908001e49fb1":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"840d8ed7-7960-4366-a194-908001e49fb1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up.md\",\"file_name\":\"build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up.md_1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up.md\",\"file_name\":\"build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"RhxmpoW/KSRddokdku4FCoO4/1QiRZkvxX2zMu5Fngs=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"52c11969-d5b5-4d96-baf8-4c9464ad1fc2\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up.md\",\"file_name\":\"build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"9ncZBGiU17e1EiOH1nFk7vFDwlij9V/uYX8xp+Yv6ds=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"b0388cf4-57b3-4196-8ff1-916500322a96\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"rWF85fyjYEnEcoP2IaogvaiUEmwIPLyoeQjbvl3D83k=\"}},\"text\":\"So

all right.Next steps, you're now ready to use Radix themes components.Cool.I will probably stop there and a good place to stop probably is now into a commit of my source code.and it should commit added vertex UI.So if you've got the GitHub extension here, you can actually also do the same as this and publish it live.Awesome, so if I open this now, I should be able to see that in Chrome.There we go and it's public so you guys should be able to see that as well.Awesome.Okay next steps.Like I said we talked about we needed Next.js setup, we needed Radix UI setup.The next probably part what we need is start talking thinking about our database.Okay it's pretty early on I know but it's good to get this up and running so we can actually start sort of planning out more of our app.Okay so let's find the Superbase website.Cool, so I've already previously signed on with GitHub before, and I need to now create a new project.OK, I'll call it LMS.and copy that password and place that somewhere where I'm not gonna lose it okay All right, OK, my password is saved now.Region.Not the closest to me.I might do Oceania Sydney there because that is closest to me.OK, I'm going to create

I need to actually run this in a dev container.Add that configuration file.And we'll just use the default for now.Let's just add it and we should be able to now reopen this in a container.So the reason I'm adding it to Container is the version of Node.I've got it on.I'm trying to use 20.Slightly experimental, all the latest.So the idea being that if I need to change, I can set my different version of node based on this dev container here.I can swap it out for something else.It just means that in sort of future proofing.Okay, so that's running, and we'll run that to super.Localhost

start the project up when it first makes those dev containers and it is going to install all the node modules.So I have that rebuild.Just saving the next person that has to probably open the project or ourselves.Another thing to do basically of installing npm packages.Okay cool, I think I'm going to stop here today.So we've got sort of like the basics there of the project.It's all been configured, It's been set up.We've grabbed a lot of parts from the existing template there for the likes of Next.js with Superbase And we've also set up our Superbase table Until next time we will do actually get the authentication running and We will try and get some data showing on the page coming from our database Hope you all enjoyed that Please like and subscribe if you haven't already That

literally a HTML header component with the H1 inside it there.We didn't place it anywhere inside our app but we can keep going on that.Let's take a look at what we've actually done so far.So we have gone through some planning last week.So let's switch to Chrome, we'll just take a look at

let's switch to Chrome, we'll just take a look at that.So in Chrome we set up the planning for the Kanban board in GitHub projects.And you can see we have created a backlog of routes and components and items that we need to do.In the in progress column we've got the header component there so that's underway.Now we can do a couple of things to help us in terms of building our React components.One thing I like to do when working on a new project is to actually have a thing called Storybook.Now Storybook is a way for us to have a playground where we can build our components in isolation.We can style them to our sort of heart's content away from the main app and it means that we can sort of configure them, set up easily the different properties for them, even have some dummy data set up so that we can maybe enable, disable, add new titles, content, you name it, that kind of thing.We can do that.I have done a previous, I believe I did a previous video on that before so if you have a look back through my YouTube channel there's some guide sort of thing on how to do that but we'll start again from scratch.We're going to add it to the project.We'll get that going.We will continue on building out our header component and we will continue on trying to start getting this project coming together.Okay, so what do we do when we want to start something?We look at the docs.Let's look for Storybook here.Storybook.js.org.So this is the one.Okay, so that's all new.Looks like they've updated it.That's cool.Okay, so if we go to the Get Started guide, that's always a good place to start.They've got a good channel on how to get it all set up and running but we'll do the same.So they want us to initially install Storybook for the project and make sure that you read this part here.Storybook is not made for empty projects.Storybook needs to be installed.If I work on empty projects, there are many ways to bootstrap in a framework.We have an app already.So I think we should be

folder and it's got the header component in it and the logout button.Okay, we have detected that you're using ESLint storybook provides a plugin that gives the best experience for storybook and helps follow best practices.Would you like to install it?Yes, I would.Okay, so it's going to add that ESLint plugin.Keep doing it.So we've got the components folder.So these components that are going to be used across the site.They're not page components as such.So it's all about working in a structure that you are going to understand.I like to keep mine relatively simple.But of course, things change.You can move stuff around as you build out your project.It's not set in stone.This is code.Remember, this is not granite that we are making our project out of.So we can undo things.Okay, so

called stories.So we can have our variations there.Story previews are interactive.So when you modify code or story, storybook automatically updates how it previews your components.And this is the key core beauty of storybook here.You are going to be able to see your components in isolation without any impact from the actual UI itself.Maybe other things could impact what your look and feel looks like.So the way that you make your components with storybook is that you then hopefully make them all just independent of each other.And that's the whole goal of building components because we want to be able to reuse them.So storybook previews are interactive.And you'll see here it's got this cool playground here where we have the controls and we can set values.We can change this value here to false.Hey, confetti.Nice.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"eE3+4rdNucdmnvePXjXTH2iHBzNF8bleEQn1tfruBbY=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"e3e80f34-5bfa-473d-9883-b95f2ebd5641":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"e3e80f34-5bfa-473d-9883-b95f2ebd5641\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md\",\"file_name\":\"build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md_1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md\",\"file_name\":\"build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"zEkxOGML2n7dLUPM4YlE+8CxsnimfJHMQbEhv3fITSo=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"0449da12-3e8a-44a8-a89d-a4aefdeac0cf\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md\",\"file_name\":\"build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"t52qOqBKC3UFrUAtKgn+ibOCl/nsn6k3nEo6hmsg2XQ=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"bba0e709-b69c-4a1e-a1d1-b27fb112c74c\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"NbVt/EjYY223q994mdM0eXHYxU++tqYgUtSGmRBsSFU=\"}},\"text\":\"We can change this value here to false.Hey, confetti.Nice.So with that, we can change that state from being primary to not being primary.So it's just got a false there.So that means that we can very quickly have just by properties alone, we can change a button to be of the primary type.So what would that be?That it could be maybe like on A form.Maybe you've got a save and a cancel.You probably make the primary button the save because that's the interaction you're trying to ask the user to do.And then the cancel would be the non-primary look.So less sort of eye-catching there.Okay.So now it's got this little wizard here on how to write a story.So these imports, first import meter and story object for type safety and autocompletion and typescript stories.We're not using the likes of typescripts.So we want to use it in this case.Next import a component, in this case, the button component.And then the default export, it contains metadata about this component stories.The title field optional controls where stories appear in the sidebar.Okay.So you got that button, you got a title.So this is what you can name it for your example here.So each named export is a story.So its content specifies how the story is rendered in addition to other configuration options.So you can have the, like in this case, the button component.The button component has these variations, one being a primary.It's in a secondary, large and small.I can see there on the left.So we follow through this.We can see all these arguments here.So in this story file, we can set up each of these stories and each have its own object.And each object has its own arguments.Okay.So these are all stuff that you set.These are the properties for the components themselves.So I would imagine this button component has got the properties of primary, label and background.Okay.So those are properties for that component.So if you cast your mind back to where your views react, maybe in the past.So properties are things that you pass into your react components.We'll go over that shortly.Okay.So we'll continue with

have a look at back to our project now.We should see a few different things here.Let's switch back to code.All right.So in our VS code, we can see the little green there.A little bit difficult to

made that folder for us.It's set up the configuration.We should see in our package.json.If we look at our source control here, we should be able to see the difference between it.And we can see there.So what has it done?What has it added to our project?It's added the storybook there.So it's got the port number running there, running the build, and then inside those dev dependencies, because these are for running locally, of course.So it's when they're in the dev dependencies folder structure.So we've got the storybook add-on essentials and add-on interactions, add-on links, add-on

all these are parts of the sort of the tutorial.And with React and testing library to go along with it with storybook itself.Okay.Cool.Okay.I'm 100% happy with that so far.If we close it.Now the one thing I'm not kind of happy about is we've got our nice sort of component structure.And this comes down to personal preference.This is not set in stone or anything.The one downside, I guess, storybook is that by initially it will store all these files.We can remove those.That's not a big problem.So let's actually go through and look at that.What are we going to need?We have our header component.Okay.And we want to have a stories component for it.We could actually just steal this, which is not a bad idea.It's going to give us some ideas as well.And why not?So we've got the header stories there.So I'm not a big fan of just having the stories folder.I prefer just to put my stories into the components instead.That way when I do so, then it's just going to sit in that folder with it.I like to keep them together.Let's do that.Okay.No, I don't want that.I don't want to hear from stories.I want the header, which is this one.Okay.So it's doing that.Now already we've got a difference here.It's got an argument of a name.This is a pretty good idea.We'll leave it at that, I think.Use this not a bad idea to show on our header component.Let's actually go back to our storybook.Not a storybook, our sketches of what we actually did for design.Because that would probably be helpful.Let's have a look at the ScalaDrawer.Okay.Did we have a username in there?No.Okay.That's okay.We don't need to have the same.So we'll just take that out for now.Sorry, I haven't switched screen.So that's our ScalaDrawer.Looking at it now, our homepage.Simply got the

through.Cool thing about CSS modules is that it will get a unique name there every time it is rendered.That's built into the next JS.So what it's doing is going through a build process, putting, appending a unique identifier on the end of the class.It uses the component name and then followed by the class name that you have in your module folder with the underscore.And then of course the unique identifier.That way, it should always be unique and you shouldn't get any CSS sort of clashes with that.So one of the benefits of using CSS modules.The other cool side of that, because everything has been put inside its own file.When you come to get rid of the component, you can feel comfortable in removing that CSS file at the same time.It's got some cons.One being, you could end up with a, if you're not diligent about your CSS styling, you could end up with a whole lot of repeated sort of classes in those individual modules.So you may need at some point to go back and

we're just going to crash now.I'm only running the storybook.Secondly, our header component does not sit in any of our actual layout for the app itself yet.It's purely sitting standalone and our

actually have a look here, it looks like a cool thing.That's working correctly.So we've got the small.We can do that.Okay, so we have small mobile layer so we can actually have a small view of it.We can have a large mobile tablet and sort of reset it can be like it is top.So it's all there.Quite cool.We've also got the likes of what else we got here.We've got the flight grid view.So you can see

just want a list of menu items.Drop down menu.Scroll area separator.Could use that.Let's go take a look back at the playground, I think.It's always good to do that.OK, so playground.We've got some sort of menu up here that could be useful.Let's have a look at the playground.Like I said, the themes all set up like that.Really cool little side note here.You can see on the right hand side we've got a whole theme builder in this playground.We can literally copy that theme, apply that to our theme provider and then we'll be set to go.It would look the same as what we're doing in here.So where was those?There's the tabs.There's the links there.Let's see if we can find it.Separator, slider, tabs, text area, text field, tooltip.They just use buttons.Can I use these badges?Let's see what they actually are.Product link.Product link container.Maybe we will have to put our own menu.OK.Always the fun part of working with any new project.This is the first time I've used Radix UI.I wanted to give it a try.A bonus of that is you get to see me fumble around.Just like you guys would if you hadn't used it as well.So we've got the tabs there.I'm not really a big fan of doing that for the tabs.I want the actual menu structure to be something that's going to work.It's going to work well on a mobile.I don't think we need a context menu like that.I don't think that's really going to be helpful.And I'm not a big fan of that.Maybe if we're more sort of app-based, rather than an LMS, maybe I would use that.I think we could just have a selection of menu items.OK.We may actually end up

we can actually incorporate it into our own custom styles, which is pretty cool.We're going to apply a theme to this project using Radix.Radix is UI themes.And then what we can do from there is we can take these tokens and actually apply them across our CSS.So for a comprehensive list of all available tokens, see their respective source files.So say like in the case of our radius.No, not so much.Think about it maybe in terms of our color.OK.So this is all the theme colors here.So with that, we would have a color of amber.These are all the tokens.We go back to the help.Let's see.So they got T file font size.So if we grab this, that's the modifying of it, but we'd be able to see all the tokens like that.OK, so we can use these for our project.So we've got font size one.We've got weight, bold, default font family.It's a whole lot there is accessible to us.We can grab these as the CSS variables that they are.And we can apply it to our own styling.So let's give it actually a try

I'm running out of time.So what we can do next time we come back to the project, we can further explore how we can get, I guess, the Radix UI theming into our storybook.Because at the moment, it doesn't actually seem like we're actually getting, we are getting our custom styles from the modules, but we're not getting our custom styles from the Radix UI because we're not embedding anything.So a quick way we could quickly test that maybe is add a button.But we have run out of time, unfortunately.So next time what I'll do is configure using the Radix UI buttons.We'll test the theming and structure out.But have a play yourself.Storybook's really good for doing this building of components in isolation.It's got some great testing tools.It's also got some accessibility tools built in as well.Have a check of those.Some of those are really great.And of course you can have all your properties based on, if you want to have like we had before, we had the primary button and the non-primary button by setting that boolean value.Then it was going to show that color, the accent color on our buttons.Cool stuff.So next time, like I said, we'll get that Radix UI set up and we'll go through and make sure that it's working and continue on with our header component.Alright, thank you for watching.Please remember to like and subscribe.And if you want, you can ring the bell.You'll get notified

how are we going to do this?Well first things, let's jump to the Superbase website because it's got a really good walkthrough there of a quick start.Okay, so you can see here it's got the likes of Superbase with XJS.That's what we're using It's asking for creating a new project on the Superbase dashboard Okay, and goes through the process of setting up a table in the database Okay, so if we go to the Superbase dashboard Okay, so I've got this this is my project the LMS one And I've got no tables in it at present.So I'm gonna create a new table just like the guide showed us and I'm gonna insert some data into it as well Of course on this one, I'm not gonna be adding countries.I am going to be adding some courses for the LMS So let's go and do so So create a new table.No, you want to pluralize the name of course, so courses.I'll disable RLS for now.You probably wouldn't want to do this.Actually, no, I'll keep it on.Let's keep it on.I'll do something else instead.thinking through.So we're gonna have the likes of a new public table, we're gonna have an ID and it's created at.This is a nice little simple user interface.You can do the same using some SQL but the interface is pretty good in terms of that.So let's do that.Okay so we're gonna need a few things I guess for a course name, a course name, so I'm going to have a name here and it's going to be some text.Or Basha, Basha probably would be better.And I'm going to add a description.Again, this one I will actually make a text.And I'm going to add another column here for some.We need to have an image, I think.Let's do that.Now, I think it could have us as some data, but probably the easiest thing to do in this scenario.Of course, we don't want to to load out a database or anything like

the created at let's save that.Okay, so we should shortly see it loading up the table.Here we go.Okay, so we've got no data in here at the moment.We've got a name, a description, an image, an ID, and

cool.I haven't seen this before.So this is, yeah that's pretty cool.AI way to add data to your database.Getting the, well, instead of having to do it as a insert there, I could have probably say add

back to our table view.Close that one.And we'll open that.Okay, so straight away we've got some new data now in our table.We've got the record there for reHJS.We've got no description or image yet, but we can start adding some more records in here.Just to get something this way on the page once we list out these from the database.I'm going to go back to the edit there.I'm going to add another one we have.CSS Okay, so that's going to add that record on as well and we'll do it one more What's number one HTML 5 HTML was new.Okay, cool, so that's added.And if we go back to our table view, sure enough, we've got those three records now.We've got a name there for each of them.It's almost a dimension description, but we can add that in later.Okay, let's go back to the guide here.Okay.And we can see here that we've got.I haven't seen that before on the hopper now.It shows you how much memory each tab is using.Pretty cool.I haven't seen that before.That's all good.Okay, so we've got these three records now and our table.Just a similar example here with the countries.We're not going to do the create next tab because we've already got it up and

you're going to need to do is go into your settings for Superbase here, just like the link here, follow this link here, it'll take you to the API page, you'll have a URL you'll have an anonymous key.You'll need to put those into an .env file and something like that.nv.local, that's a good place to start.Add those keys in there and that's what I've already done.So if we look at my code.Okay, so just like I said, I've got an example file here, you'd add those keys in there.Make sure you stop and start so that you get your environment keys to load because without it your app won't reload the environment variables unless you do that.Okay so once you've done that you've added those keys in there.We can go back to the tutorial.Okay and it's got an example here.They've got a page that they've created, so countries page.Okay so that's for a type script file and what they've done is they've created a component, used the cookies there to import the header there and then it does a call off to the Superbase library and gets the countries for that.So for those that maybe have done some SQL in the past it pretty much is very much a similar sort of look to SQL for Superbase.So their whole, I guess their model for being able to retrieve from your tables, again using a from there, there's your word in the select statement, and you've got a this select statement at the end there, hand by default I believe, having no value in the actual brackets there means that you're going to get all the columns on the

let's start something like this up, let's actually go and add something like this to our page.Now we can add a new page so it might be a good idea to have a courses page.So I'm going to jump into this

of Next.js, it has a quite basic setup in terms of the app router, layout being the actual what's going to be displayed in terms of layout, and page is the actual sort of content for it.So if we look at layout there, we've got a layout we're loading in some styles etc.\\n\\nwhich is all cool.Now let's go and go and add a new folder.Okay, so the App Router works basically by having a new folder name and in it you can have a page file.So I'm going to have a folder called countries.Like that.Okay, so we've got the countries and we're going to need a page file.All right.And we're going to need to have a component on there.So what would that look like?That could be something along the lines of this maybe.So we're just typing that out.We're going to export a export default and we're going to need to have this be async because we're going to be pulling in data for this home component.Maybe I should just call it, call it horses.Okay and in that we will need to have, we're going to actually import the Superbase library.So if you haven't, we probably should actually check to see if we've got this installed.Always we won't be able to.Yes I have installed it in the past.Okay So what you could do in terms of that is go to the command line, run npm install and superbase js and superbase auth help as an xjs as dependencies that look something like this.And we can take those same two libraries.So the great thing about npm on the install command there is you can actually have multiple items in there.Okay, this shouldn't make much

like this.Okay, so the cookie's there.and we then need to have a way to retrieve data.Look at that, it's actually even, it's copied the same bit of text there that is sitting on the, probably enough, the tutorial.We're not going to grab from the countries, we're going to grab from the courses And like I mentioned before, it's very much like an SQL statement.So you've got the from there, so the

that.And there's a reason for that.And it's basically to do with the security here for the app.So what we need to do to make that accessible, we can do a couple of things, but probably the easiest one to do so is go into our table and what we can do for it is set the policies on it.Okay, let's view policies.And what we want to actually do is we want to make a new policy for this.They've got some, this is basically Superbase's way of making sure that only information that's supposed to be accessible is accessible to the right users.And they've got these nice little policies here.So in this one, it's basically just a template wizard.You can select from one of these.So in our case we actually want to say that the courses are easy to be seen from the, I guess from a non-logged in user.So I do want to enable red axis to everyone here.So if I use this template that's going to let me apply that.You've got really granular control here with Superbase in it.you can actually set what operations

sort of our database Tables directly from the likes of Superbase, it's made it very simple to do the likes of our select requests and unlike As you can imagine having a kind of syntax like this is

as we reload it we can see there that it's got the likes of all those three descriptions that I've just placed on.Okay, so we've got to check on how that's looking under the skin and the HTML that's rendered out.Okay, so So yeah, sure, I've got image, H3 and PTAC.Cool.So you can see it's quite easy to start creating all your tables that you require.We can start building out the rest of our structure.And I'll probably call pause on this today.We're probably at the sort of starting point of now actually getting to the nitty gritty of actually building elements into our app.So we'll start creating some of these tables here.What I will do is I will also publish or any changes I've made and commit them and push to GitHub.For those that are following along, you'd be able to pull down the latest version of the app and you'll be able to see where it is.And then what I might also do is I might actually grab the SQL for the tables and the data itself as well.So if you want to pull them into your own version of it, you can do that as well.Next time I'm going to go over fleshing out more that data structure.So what I'll do is we'll go into some database diagramming just so that we've

\\\"storybook-welcome.png\\\"\\n---\\n\\nyoutube.com/embed/fpUPw9Yu5NA\\n\\nIn this guide, I will walk you through getting started creating your own UI Component library with ReactJS, TypeScript and Storybook.You will need Node.js installed as a prerequisite, so install this first (if not already installed).Open a terminal where you want to start working, we will create a new folder with our new project.We are using Create React App in this example but the steps are similar to ViteJS and NextJS.Run the following command:\\n\\n```shell\\nnpx create-react-app your-ui-library-name --template typescript\\n```\\n\\nThis will use CRA with the TypeScript template to create a new project.Next we will install Storybook.Make sure you are in the directory that contains your project using `cd your-ui-library-name`, replace `your-ui-library-name` with your own projects name.```shell\\nnpx storybook init\\n```\\n\\nThis will install Storybook in your project and add some default files.Let's get it running so we can make sure the installation went well.```shell\\nnpm run storybook\\n```\\n\\nYou should now see a welcome screen in your default browser like the following:\\n\\n{% image \\\"./storybook-welcome.png\\\", \\\"Storybook welcome screen\\\" %}\\n\\nWhen building a component UI library it's best to start building the smallest components that will make up the UI library.I suggest starting with some basic components like Headings & Buttons followed by common form controls.The storybook documentation on the welcome screen has a link to a great site quickly summarising component driven development.By default, Storybook creates a folder called `stories` that contains component files, stories files and CSS files all matching the appropriate component name.For example `header.css`, `Header.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"8feYf8EF4/kO6SEwkDQa1TjknAGkMN6PCUq86NT1Cqw=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"4fcc131a-0a7c-4237-8c81-ae7c77754cce":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"4fcc131a-0a7c-4237-8c81-ae7c77754cce\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/create-your-own-ui-component-library.md\",\"file_name\":\"create-your-own-ui-component-library.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/create-your-own-ui-component-library.md_1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/create-your-own-ui-component-library.md\",\"file_name\":\"create-your-own-ui-component-library.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"aRKdS+TYoXBqc5aUKBcDogqujl1EVzSSDYNZzUQj6oU=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"7831a685-454a-4218-8d3c-9ffbac8c7277\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/create-your-own-ui-component-library.md\",\"file_name\":\"create-your-own-ui-component-library.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"8feYf8EF4/kO6SEwkDQa1TjknAGkMN6PCUq86NT1Cqw=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"7197be35-74f1-4d8d-b807-402ddd90088f\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"UEyOBfZaOfO7e8D9ZMbrc+lNXzZzEtCNxvp8/jjU8ws=\"}},\"text\":\"For example `header.css`, `Header.tsx` and `Header.stories.tsx`.My preference is to instead create a `components` and `pages` folder.In the components folder, I will have the component file, the stories file and the CSS module together as they are all part of the whole.I use the pages folder for the top-level components that are used by a router for example React Router.All my other components that are made up of the simple ones are also placed in the `components` folder, like a login form for example.We are now going to copy the `button.css`, `Button.stories.tsx` and `Button.tsx` files into the `components` folder.This is a great example to start with for our Button component.Now you can delete the `stories` folder created by Storybook.Create React App, NextJS etc support CSS Modules by default.CSS Modules let you use the same CSS class name in different files without worrying about naming clashes.Let's change this button component CSS file to `button.module.css`.Open `Button.tsx` and replace the reference to the `button.css` file with the following:\\n\\nFrom this:\\n\\n```ts\\nimport \\\"./button.css\\\";\\n```\\n\\nTo this:\\n\\n```ts\\nimport styles from \\\"./button.module.css\\\";\\n```\\n\\nIn the `Button.tsx` file you can see the properties for the component have been defined with `interface ButtonProps`.Notice the \\\"size\\\" with options of small, medium and large.We are going to make some adjustments to the CSS and logic of the component to work with CSS Modules.Open the `button.module.css` file and rename the CSS classes from kebab-case to camelCase.We will also rename to a more generic name, by removing the \\\"storybook\\\" from the class names.{% image \\\"./rename-css.png\\\", \\\"Rename CSS from kebab case to camel case\\\" %}\\n\\nNow we need to update the button component with the class names from the CSS module.```tsx\\nexport const Button = ({\\n  primary = false,\\n  size = \\\"medium\\\",\\n

Introduction & Getting Started\\n\\nSo in this video we're going to end up with three components in our own custom\\nstorybook.So you need to open your terminal and we're going to install the latest vite\\nreact and typescript template.```sh\\nnpm create vite@latest mui-customisation -- --template react-ts\\n```\\n\\nWe now need to open VS Code and we're going to open up the folder with the\\nproject that we've just created.Now I like to use dev containers when I'm working on projects.Open the command palette, command shift p or control shift p and select dev\\ncontainers add dev container configuration file, then add it to the workspace\\nand type in **Nodejs & Typescript** and use the defaults there.Once this is finished a alert will say to reopen any container and we want to do\\nthis to load it under docker.You will also be asked to rebuild the container.Once that completes the terminal will allow us to install the latest version of\\nstorybook to follow through the defaults here.```sh\\nnpx storybook@latest init\\n```\\n\\nNow close the little pop-up here and use **Ctrl + C** to end the terminal\\nsession.Now let's ensure all our packages are installed.I like to use the prettier code formatter so I make sure that I've got the\\nextension installed.Now let's open up a terminal, install the prettier package\\nand let's make a new file for the prettier config.```sh\\nnpm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier\\n```\\n\\n`prettierrc.json`\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"tabWidth\\\": 2,\\n  \\\"semi\\\": true,\\n  \\\"singleQuote\\\": false,\\n  \\\"arrowParens\\\": \\\"avoid\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nSo that's `prettierrc.json` and then we add the json config that we want to use.Under the storybook directory we want to start by opening up the `main.ts` file\\nand then we're going to add some add-ons to it.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"iQMVpgVfH+33T5GozLdWYo5mEeko/CC7Tm/c4N2kE5E=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"4caa975e-dff3-4c90-99cb-ec8cdd477df0":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"4caa975e-dff3-4c90-99cb-ec8cdd477df0\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/custom-components-mui.md\",\"file_name\":\"custom-components-mui.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/custom-components-mui.md_2\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/custom-components-mui.md\",\"file_name\":\"custom-components-mui.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"i6dlD+pwxqkQpuJzU7bEimpUXcg6kS+KxBlv8HivyGY=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"9d63e45b-ae24-438d-aae7-0959648c76b2\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/custom-components-mui.md\",\"file_name\":\"custom-components-mui.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"iQMVpgVfH+33T5GozLdWYo5mEeko/CC7Tm/c4N2kE5E=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"6abee511-abf2-4078-8314-4948b9d7c7bf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"V5doiejOeAO1aMuoYHKgBaPoYmEakixymd4W06bxjsQ=\"}},\"text\":\"ts`

a\\nlot of elements that are going to make up the component.So this is the data table and in it it will need to import a whole lot of\\ncomponents.As you can see here there's table, table body, table cell, table container,\\ntable head and table row.Next we'll make an interface for the data for the table and interface for the\\nheader cell.And an interface for the table header props made up of the header cells.The table props come next where we've got the data, the head cell and whether\\nthe table is zebra striped.So we're going to need a table header component which is going to take the\\nproperties needed for that header row.And now for the component itself which is the data table.We can de-structure the props for the table into the variables we want to use.We're now going to use the esx prop which is a shortcut used for defining custom\\nstyles that also has access to the theme.So now I've made a SX variable and if the property for zebra striped is true\\nthen it's going to set the background color to the gray that's available from\\nmui.We're going to add the table container, table header etc and to the table row\\ncomponent we're going to add the sx object to the sx props.So that's going to allow us to customize the table row to show the zebra\\nstriping if it has been set to true.We now need to make a data table stories file `DataTable.stories.tsx`.GitHub Source - DataTable.stories.tsx\\n\\nAnd like previously we need to import the component and we also need to create a\\nutilities file.We're going to create our data on top of that.As usual we need to pull in the meta and the story object.And then we need to set these meta so that it gets all the properties.Now of course we need to export that, create the story.We need to make a set of data for the

been a teacher for about two years in software development and I just thought I'd like to share some more knowledge while I can.Well I've got some free time anyway.Okay what are dev containers?So a dev container is a pre-configured development environment that is packaged up as a container image.This image includes all of the tools and dependencies that are needed to develop a particular application.These dev containers can be used to create a consistent development experience for developers, regardless of their operating system or machine configuration.So Mac, Linux, Windows.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"Rao27rb1NxtEkPKFSdRrE5XurIWeAQ96WCJrZ5UN1Kg=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"9fdff8f0-74d1-40d6-9e87-def26a844989":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"9fdff8f0-74d1-40d6-9e87-def26a844989\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"file_name\":\"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md_1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"file_name\":\"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"f34b+Ie6PX0feefP9+/oL0/H3z6BMylV64cBpcvWz4o=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"43ddc8bc-b800-4b59-a3cb-bf7932b26bd4\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"file_name\":\"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"Rao27rb1NxtEkPKFSdRrE5XurIWeAQ96WCJrZ5UN1Kg=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"61137027-9f76-4ee6-94f1-9dc9d5e39897\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"qU9z6oIFD1a4hufxcS+DO0c5gWzaEobzV7Pp521OQ4Y=\"}},\"text\":\"So Mac, Linux, Windows.They can also be used to improve the productivity of developers by providing them with a ready-to-use environment that does not require any setup or configuration.So these dev containers are typically created using a tool like Docker and VS Code.And Docker provides a way to create and manage container images.And to create the dev container, you first need to create a devcontainer JSON file.This file specifies the contents of the container image.The devcontainer json file can be used to install tools, dependencies, and configure the environment.So a big part of software development is dependencies and managing your environment.So this can take care of that for you.Why would you want to use devcontainers?Devkit containers can be a valuable tool for improving the development experience.They can help to create a consistent development environment, improve productivity and reduce the risk of errors.That's all stuff we want to do.As we develop things, okay, so consistency.That's a big one.Consistent development experience.Okay, so dev containers can help to create a consistent development experience for developers regardless of their operating system or machine configuration.So this can help to improve productivity and reduce the risk of errors.So stopping that tool works on my machine, but doesn't work on yours that kind of thing the improved productivity is is dev containers can help to improve the productivity by providing developers with a ready-to-use environment that does not require any setup or configuration.We love that, don't we?Being able to just get started without having to battle through a config.So that can save a whole little time and frustration.Reduce risk of errors.So dev containers can help to reduce the risk of errors by isolating the development environment from the production environment.This can help to prevent errors from being introduced in the production environment.Hey people, integrated with VS Code, but development experience is much nicer than working with Docker containers alone.So one cool thing is with VS Code and the containers is that the terminal can actually be looking at the container itself, which is pretty awesome.So it's a UI one there.Another real benefit of it is the ability to run in Codespaces.What are Codespaces, you're probably asking?\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"naM8AjMs/iM7WOYGl02xV/4nJejclOOQlPmFkbaOhLA=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"61137027-9f76-4ee6-94f1-9dc9d5e39897":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"61137027-9f76-4ee6-94f1-9dc9d5e39897\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"file_name\":\"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md_1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"file_name\":\"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"f34b+Ie6PX0feefP9+/oL0/H3z6BMylV64cBpcvWz4o=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"9fdff8f0-74d1-40d6-9e87-def26a844989\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"file_name\":\"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"OlpoAPOCO7NFaZesXAOORk4+xomRPE429qQn8ucVX98=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"626d1712-c9d5-46d3-8e50-55b0b9e1baf9\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"AQuNwjzfcpFLQUR+2K7G5dfFZKCWc0uTNgo8oQFxUvI=\"}},\"text\":\"What are Codespaces, you're probably asking?So it's basically a thing that GitHub has, where you can run one of these dev containers on a machine in the cloud.And you can do all your development.You can even share it with other developers.You can show off what you're working on.And it's all pretty much just a quick way of sharing what you're currently working on.Maybe you've got some really big requirements.Maybe you're working on a low spec machine and you need something with a lot of RAM.With the dev containers there, you could specify that machine to have a whole lot of RAM, and then you'd be able to use that in the cloud.Now you can use that in VS Code, or you can even use it in a browser, which is pretty cool.Okay, the other cool thing with Dev Containers is that it's easy swapping between projects with different dependencies.Say you had a project that was using Node.js 16 and this new one needed 20.By running the containers, neither version will be installed on your local file system.Instead, it's going to be sitting in those containers and it's going to keep your computer craft free, which is really handy.As you can imagine, every time that you'd want to have to switch between to node 16 and 20, you'd have to use some other tool to do that.And the same thing could be had between, say, different versions of Python or .NET Core for starters.And being able to easily switch between them just by running up a container means we don't have to worry about what's installed on your machine.Okay so if you're looking away to improve the development experience, Dev Containers are a great option and they can help to create that consistent development environment that will improve productivity and reduce the risk of errors.Cool.A few friendly faces that I can see

image here and this might help sort of cement this visual model of what is actually happening.Okay so on the left you've got the local operating system and inside that you've got the VS code, you've got the theme, your UI, your extensions, blah blah blah.But you've also got the source code.Okay so that's all sitting on your local machine.So you've pulled down, cloned down a repo down to your machine and you've now got that source code there.You've got the vs code, pretty much the same as what you're used to.It's pretty normal.But when you have a devcontainer.json file, one of the things that the yes code will do is it will pop up a little pop up saying \\\"Would you like to open this in a container?\\\"And when it does that, so what just like as you would if you typed docker from the client line or docker compose with a docker file, that would then pull down those image, set that up locally on your machine and then make it available to work on.Okay so what does it do?You can see there on the right in the container you've got this VS Code server.So what it actually does is it actually runs VS Code the server which is another open source project, runs that locally in that container, it mounts the source code that's sitting on your machine and then with that container there you've got the file system, you've got the terminal process, you've got the running application debugger, all those are accessible from the VS Code server and VS Code opens that port and can read that VS Code server there and so it's just literally imaging what is in that same container.Cool.Okay so let's actually let's go through set up a small project and we'll add a dev container to it and so you can see how it actually works.Okay let's get started with that.So we're

extension ID here.If you do search for that in your own VS code, that should come up with the right one.And you're going to need to install it of course.It's got a few other prerequisites and it will

doing right now.I'm just going to clear that.Okay so I'm going to use Next we use the create next app to start building a little project that we're going to add, make it a dev container.Okay so NPX, maybe something I've prepared earlier, there we go, create next app at latest.So it's going to use the latest version there of next.Hit enter, cool okay, my mixed dev container there we go, the name for the project.We're not going to use TypeScript, I am going to use eslint, we'll use Tailwind, fix the source directory, add router and we're not going to customize the import there.Okay probably seen this before if you've used next.Great way to get started with a project.It sets all your templates up for you.You can see there it's installing all those.Awesome.Okay so now we've got a project sitting under there.My next dev container.So I'm going to start.And there.And I'll start going up from the command line there.All right.Zoom in a little bit.Make it easier to read.How are we looking?Cool.Okay.Normal sort of node project, JavaScript project.If we open it up, okay, so we've got some layout files, page etc.\\n\\nPretty much standard what we've been always used

enough, it's the top of my list here because it's recently been used.Dev containers add dev container configuration files.Okay, when I add that it gives me a whole lot of options.There's pretty much every single sort of image you can think of.You know, you can use standard Alpine, Debian, got some node ones and what we're gonna do is I'm gonna choose this one so this is a node.js and a PostgreSQL container.Okay I'm gonna add that I'm just gonna use the default there of 20 and what I can also do is I can actually install a whole lot of other features.So why would you want to do this?You can see at the top there there's one password CLI.So that's a if you use 1 password you can use that to you know do your logins etc.\\n\\nYou can do it all straight from the terminal inside the container.And of course you've got plenty of other options here.Anaconda and people doing some builds or something.App packages, maybe you want to update the container.Even Astro CLI.Yeah there's quite a few options there.Are those default options actually?Let's do all.I can find it.The common.I probably won't have to select it because it's already, yeah it's already part of it I believe.But the common utilities case things like OhMyZSH and a few other nice little to haves.I'm gonna add it, it's not gonna hurt.Okay and I'm gonna click OK there.The defaults will be pretty pretty much what you need.We'll just go through them just to have a quick look but you can see there it's just this configuration of those common there.So whatever you are adding in terms of software.It's going to give

see there.So what we have here we're looking at the dev container json file so this is what's just been added.It's got a few things pre-configured there it's got the name of it, nodejs + postgressql so that was the container that we selected first up.It's got for those sort of used docker before you probably would have seen a docker compose file and you can also see there on the right there is a docker file okay so what are we gonna do with the little pop-ups gone we're not gonna panic for starters but we can bring that back up again so if we do Command + Shift + P okay and go dev containers and we can do rebuild or open, okay open the folder in the container, we'll start with that one.It's uh oh I'm sorry where am I?Open, rebuild, don't worry, open in container.Okay very quickly, didn't really see that, here we go.If you click on that quickly while you still have time.It might be slower for you or faster depending if you've got the images already on your local machine.But once that's done is what we would normally have to do if we were using just Docker alone, we'd go into the directory, we'd start docker compose, of course it would look at the compose file, start the docker and we'd all be running in that container.Okay, You'll notice one little sort of point of difference when you are running under a container there.You can see down in the bottom left here, okay, so it's saying that we are editing on Dev Container, Nodejs and Postgres SQL.And it's basically if you pop that open, you've got a few other options here for things like attaching to the running container,

like I mentioned previously, you can even create a new code space with it.Okay, I'm gonna start a new terminal.Okay, you've noticed anything about my terminal that it looks slightly different.So when we were in the VS Code previously, I definitely wasn't in a WorkSpaces folder, I was in my developer folder I believe, and I had a YouTube folder where I've created this project.So what we're actually looking at when we're looking at the terminal right now is what's in the container there.How do we prove this.So we can do something like this.We can see the version there.Okay so it's saying that the node version there is version 20.Okay like when I, if you can cast your mind back you may want to jump back in the video later after we finished.But you would have seen when I was setting up the devcontainer.json file there was this section there of the version of node for that image and it was version 20.And when I selected that, that of course has installed that version.Okay so hopefully a lot of you, some of you may be more seasoned developers remember the pain of trying to support maybe a legacy application.Maybe it's running on an old version of node and you really want to install that but you don't want to have to go through maybe breaking your dev environment for something else that you've got running.So these dev containers are a way for you, maybe you're working on something in node 16, and maybe you're working on another project in node 20.Because they're all self-contained in these containers, and the whole development experience feels just like you're developing locally, you get a premium experience with the ability to have any dependencies that you need they're sitting in those containers and available to you at minus notice, which is way better than having to change all your whole configuration again.I've got one question in the chat.So the dev container JSON is used to generate the Docker files or it has other uses as well.So what does it have?Let's get back to it.Okay, I'll just close the terminal.Okay, OK.It's got basically, let's just go through each part first.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"U5L3qN5+HnkMHduG1Z1wJ7E6dFmVP2fJhVXPlzU5uo4=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"721412b2-95f0-4d60-a3da-0c81df4cccda":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"721412b2-95f0-4d60-a3da-0c81df4cccda\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"file_name\":\"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md_1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"file_name\":\"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"f34b+Ie6PX0feefP9+/oL0/H3z6BMylV64cBpcvWz4o=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"549f54e6-11d0-49f2-a5c6-72db7c367f50\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"file_name\":\"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"PuF7FqYFtnRvApB+Eskg0z6LpkcvVxzWyO3q0jAZQJA=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"e31cd0ad-18bf-4033-91de-a71ecb1a044a\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"u7jY64rnSB1SFm5YV0go85Qq++DZjr29X2oEWWJgbb8=\"}},\"text\":\"Okay, OK.It's got basically, let's just go through each part first.So first of all, you've got a name so you can rename this to whatever you would like.You've got the docker compose file so it's actually created a docker compose file there in this directory.We'll have a look at that in a sec.And you've got a docker file.For those that maybe you've looked at a Docker compose or Docker file before and then we have a service and a service has the name.So this is actually linking to that app straight out of the box.We've not had to set that all up for us and again the WorkSpaces folder again has been pre-configured for us again using that base folder name.So when we were looking at that previously in the terminal we could see, was it my dev container.Okay, also this dev container has things like the features there, so we've got all the features configuration there for zsh.And not only that, you can also set up, which is probably what a lot of people would like, is things like port forwarding.So you got the port 3000, which is the standard port for Next.js and we've also got the standard port there for Postgres.Okay so that's going to make the container have those ports open to us so that we're going to be able to use other tools to be able to view things like things like browser and I'm going show you it's sort of using a RMS tool to be able to connect to a database.So again we've got all that set up and we've got the ports.One other thing that we can do which again making this whole developer experience much more smoother.What's normally the first thing you do when you have a no project when you want to get started.That is that you're going to have to install an A module, don't you?And so one way to automate that whole process is we do actually have the ability to have this post create command.So once the container has all been created, we can use this post create command to then fire off the, in our case I'm going to use npm, install here and then I don't have to go through the hassle there of going to actually happen to menu and do it.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"PWvUIiI/7I3hBdBy3suyoOvde7imMFtoYGBh0Yq18Ak=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"e31cd0ad-18bf-4033-91de-a71ecb1a044a":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"e31cd0ad-18bf-4033-91de-a71ecb1a044a\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"file_name\":\"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md_1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"file_name\":\"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"f34b+Ie6PX0feefP9+/oL0/H3z6BMylV64cBpcvWz4o=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"721412b2-95f0-4d60-a3da-0c81df4cccda\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"file_name\":\"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"pvD7iThjTyYWdYqfWVV8koviCyjGvXAm5/Q/331bBLY=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"c5fec9c7-b0f1-4807-879e-b8a2d46b3463\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"WTCR/p5e4+mxaoCls+eGWTf8UDKJ7i+/rMPaBYRNm1o=\"}},\"text\":\"I

said before, we are running on the node 20 here.Just to prove that, I'm going to show you my terminal.Oh, it's saying there.You can see here I'm running 18.Okay, so the cool thing about this, this is all self-contained.You know, you could take this whole setup now, I can event this to say the GitHub and give it to my fellow workmate.They would be able to clone it down as long as they've got Docker and they've got the dev containers extension.When they fire it up and they load up their VS Code, it'll ask them, do they want to open this in a container, which I hope they do, they'll open in a container and it will go through this whole process, everything will be set up for them, the version of node, all the npm modules, all ready to go.And all that they're going to have to do is do something like this.Come into npm scripts, or no different than actually running it from here, so I'll we'll do it from the terminal just to show.So npm run dev.So that's starting up.So I now switch back to Chrome.I open my localhost, all right so now I've got just the standard sort of loading page for nextjs there.It's running from a container, the ports are being forwarded, so I know that the ports here being redirected you can see there I've got that Localize 3000.Let's also have a look at what is happening on the Docker site.Okay looks familiar we've got our project name and inside it

so one is running the next app and the other one is running Postgres in there.So this database of course is empty but I would be able to connect to it say from something like I've got bee keeper studio open here.If I connect to that, I believe it's Postgres of the password by default, I connect to that.Empty database, awesome.So of course, you know, whole empty environment's all ready to rock in just a few seconds.If you're using the same sort of container images of course on lots of different projects, you know speed's going to vary, but generally it's not too slow.And the cool thing is that even the database is contained.So in this case, just trying to remember what's the Postgres version.We can find out actually, we can go to the Docker files probably in here.Docker compose.So let's just get him the latest version of Postgres there.So again, this shouldn't be anything different to anyone that's used Docker before.You've probably seen images etc.\\n\\nSo if we went to Docker Hub and we looked for that.Talk to you in the lab.Wait, no hands?Hmm, I didn't let that run.I'm not sure what's going on, but whatever the latest version of PostScript there, it's setting up that one.So again, like I was talking before about any project is going to have some dependencies of some sort.There may be something that you can't upgrade straight away.It's going to require a whole lot of refactoring.So because the dev containers are all self-contained, we could use an older version and not have to worry about an effecting our local machine.Let's go back to VS Code there.Alright.Okay, let's just have a quick walk through this compose file.Again, like I said, very much the same.It's got the services as you normally would have.It's got the app and it's got the bb.And it's got that all ready to rock because you've got the environment variables there and the volume mount all set up ready.So this project now is actually running in a container.I can refresh, I

just makes it a little bit easier to separate out all the three different parts of a mono repo.Okay, so this client, we have a docker file for your client, we have a docker file for the server, it's running a sort of pin sort of stack, so postgres, express, react, and node, and if we go down to here we can see we have a docker compose file.Okay so I can start this up just as I would normally.I can go docker-compose up and get that actual project up and running in a container which is perfectly fine.That's a that's a great way to to work and I probably wouldn't use a dev container as such if I had a project like this but we can.So we're going to show you how you can do that if you want to.So the easiest way to probably do that is we'll just close this.We're going to jump back into the terminal here and I'm going to use docker compose up and build.Okay so it's got a database there.Setting up a little configuration.Just waiting on the client.Okay, pretty typical.So in a production environment, of course, you're going to want to have sort of like a container like this.The good thing about it is you'd be able to, you know, set up a different container for each of the different parts of the the application.It should be sitting on their own version and of course you know if you were setting up something really big and chunky you'd probably use some sort of container management and you may end up having maybe two versions of the API and two versions of the client or something like that just for in terms of ability to handle larger loads

do is you can set up the dev container file, attach it to the Docker file and because the dev container runs as before it when you're running in a development environment, you can make it install those feel-like tools but only in dev.OK and then use the existing Dockerfile for when it's actually creating container for production.Pretty nice.OK we've sort of got the debugger working.I'm just

I'd recommend you do it in the configuration file because of course you want it to be able to work for I guess your other teammates or other developers they want to be able to just get started and get the application running and that will be a bit of a roadblocker there if the ports aren't folded and they won't be able to sort of view the I guess the database or the API etc so you need those ports open best to keep that configuration in that dev container file and of course that's not going to impact your docker file, so if the project is already running in production etc it's just sort of sitting separate to it.The other cool thing with dev containers is that you can actually install extensions for a container.You know when I was going at the start where we were talking about the actual on the left was the browser page on the left you've got the VS code there you know with the extensions etc and a key thing there you've got a workspace extension so the cool thing is so if the project is you know where it's gonna need some of these extensions you can actually configure it to be set up so that when someone else comes along to start the project up they can have those extensions already ready to go installed on their machine as well.So let's do that.People can see that.Okay so you got no no containers on there as such.So say if I wanted to have I don't know what's something good.A spellcheeker.Okay.No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.Look at the icons they tell you.See?Yeah.What's something else?Docker?something that's actually probably, either the normal one would be maybe prettier.That's a pretty common one.So I can install in that dev container there.And so then your project would then have that listed.So if we see that, that's sort of locally installed.And now I've got this dev container here.Great for when you want to get some started with running up on a project and have all those extensions there they're going to help them with their development.Cool

be able to have all those things like all your extensions there.I'll show you there in the dev container file.We should have the extensions.Use it.Maybe it's Docker.Maybe it's because I already had it

environment.I mean, you could potentially use this on an iPad or some other device, maybe a Chromebook something like that you'd be able to do your development there, check it in, commit it, make it available to others to see.So let's see, you got the whole configuring up of that of course and port forwarding etc but yeah we can run this whole application sitting in the cloud here.I've got a nice little client here, I've got some, you can see my username there, you can see that's running in that browser.Again, lots of potential there to do all sorts of things.Cool.Questions?Does anyone have any questions?No, hopefully I've done a good job then.Is there a cost to use this?Definitely for the Codespaces there is a cost.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"q7RH1CJ9jz5OcO2BXvZ2fXT3RJSEsPuiPAwxhfDDe1w=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"89f08f2f-2594-4120-a7dd-c6206cf7bf95":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"89f08f2f-2594-4120-a7dd-c6206cf7bf95\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"file_name\":\"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md_1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"file_name\":\"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"f34b+Ie6PX0feefP9+/oL0/H3z6BMylV64cBpcvWz4o=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"2ac0d436-9bc8-484b-b6fc-eb5c9d3c4e4a\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"file_name\":\"dev-containers-in-vs-code.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"QhQ0LlhTkGM3QjJa196xqPDt/47M13ZfNALbzcyS9sg=\"}},\"text\":\"Is

software engineer, and full stack developer.I decided in August to take a side step in to teaching.While I had mentored many junior developers over my career this was something new and exciting to me.Getting the chance to impart my knowledge and skills on to a new generation of developers sounded exciting and fresh.Most importantly the job was remote too.Starting the job I had a two week window to get acquainted with what I'd be teaching and immerse myself in the content that had already been created (exercises and projects) before I started teaching.Once the term started and I was teaching two lessons a day to 25 students online via Google Meet.Teaching them first how to get Git set up on their computers and all the other software needed to start developing.While the first couple of lessons felt quite daunting, after a week I felt completely at ease with the students.I feel in the short time I've been teaching, my understanding of JavaScript and HTML/CSS has improved greatly.Even after using these technologies for **20 years**.When you have to explain how and why things work the way that they do you always want to be prepared for those questions from students.Because I can assure you they are going to ask hard questions.You continually want to keep improving your teaching style and approach too.There are even times you will have to change tact with how you are teaching mid lesson.It definitely keeps you on your toes.The biggest change I've found in my own well being is the feeling of satisfaction now with what I do in my

I've been using LastFM for years to track my listening habits and I thought it would be great to use their API to do so. The hard part though was my site is \\\"static\\\" built with eleventy (11ty), it's a static site generator which means a build process puts all the files together and turns it into HTML every time I push commits to GitHub. The files are static and can't dynamically change like a Node.js or Wordpress website. So I needed a way to get the data from LastFM and display it on my site. I could have used a JavaScript fetch request to get the data, but that would mean exposing my API key to the world. I needed a way to get the data securely and Netlify (serverless) functions was the answer.\\n\\nHere is the transcript from my latest how-to guide on how to make a LastFM widget for your own website showing your last played song that uses Netlify functions (serverless functions).\\n\\nyoutube.com/embed/okbDFf-eIqk\\n\\n---\\n\\nHi everyone, it's Andrew here and I'm here to show you a new tutorial on how to build a last FM widget on your website.

Create a Serverless function\\n\\nWith Netlify, it's very easy to add serverless functions to your project.Serverless functions, also known as Functions As A Service, are a way of building and running computer programs without needing to worry about the underlying servers or infrastructure.Instead, a cloud provider takes care of managing the servers and resources, and developers can just write and deploy their code.Serverless functions are triggered by specific events or requests and can quickly execute and shut down when they're finished.This makes them efficient, cost-effective and flexible, and they're often used for tasks that don't require continuous running or need to handle a lot of traffic.To be able to make a fetch request, I'm going to add the Node fetch package to my project, so we can make a get request from the Last FM API to get the last played track for my account.```sh\\nnpm install -D node-fetch@3\\n```\\n\\nOnce we have that setup, we can create a JavaScript function to make the get request return the result.I've made my function an imported node fetch, and then made a handler function for my get request.I then pulled in my API key from the environment file that we created, and then you can see here we have a request with the API key added as a string literal.I then created a last track object and retrieved the appropriate details from the JSON data requested and finally returned the result.You can see I have my Last FM username in the string for the URL that we're calling.You will need to replace that with your own username.```javascript\\nimport fetch

teaching\\n  - instructor\\n  - reflection\\ndescription: A reflection on my practice as an instructor teaching Software Development at Developers Institute.---\\n\\nAs a software developer of twenty-plus years, changing my career focus to teaching software development has been a radical change.While I have lots of experience in software development, I only have limited teaching experience.This was previously gained on the job mentoring junior developers in the workplace.Of course, being relatively new to teaching, there is much room for personal improvement, especially on the learning theory side.But even though this time frame has been short, my teaching practices have constantly evolved through trial and error.Improved from advice from the rest of the teaching team and, most recently, from taking the DCTL course.The institute (Developers Institute) I work at has some critical points of difference in how we teach compared to most tertiary education providers.First, the entire school is remote only, learners and teaching teams alike.This heavily impacts our teaching process in all manner of study, teaching and assessment for our learners.We have to lean into digital learning every day.We follow the Community of Inquiry teaching model developed by Garrison, Anderson & Archer[^1] to facilitate this.So that engaged learning occurs, we must have interaction through the three core elements:\\n\\n- Social presence - which I do by using tools like Google Meet or Zoom so that the learners can see and hear their peers and me (we ask the learners to leave their cameras on, which improves social presence).They can ask questions, and we can interact on the call.- Cognitive presence - where to keep the learners engaged, I use digital tools such as Miro for online white-boarding, the screen can be shared on the video calling software, and the link to the board can be directly shared (via a browser) for the class.This can be helpful for the learners to go back and look at the board again after class or during the course to collaborate, letting learners add sticky notes and text etc., to fully engage with what is being taught.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"y67JL7xUM+csBQH35nTLkO7DOnhkhl04zBRjUhQ7KsI=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"1c51fe02-a53e-4263-ab95-e2b6f6ed8618":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"1c51fe02-a53e-4263-ab95-e2b6f6ed8618\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/reflecting-practice-instructor.md\",\"file_name\":\"reflecting-practice-instructor.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/reflecting-practice-instructor.md_1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/reflecting-practice-instructor.md\",\"file_name\":\"reflecting-practice-instructor.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"147gTsCY2YVGn58PlXXRt6QZAQlLcnGarKoqrIcgsI8=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"43cee27e-4fbf-41ec-a4c0-80ceaedb99e6\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/reflecting-practice-instructor.md\",\"file_name\":\"reflecting-practice-instructor.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"y67JL7xUM+csBQH35nTLkO7DOnhkhl04zBRjUhQ7KsI=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"01601e43-37d6-4508-97e1-c3bffd8b7139\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"49rLvJZOCBKt/LxzLD3x7gVCK5jrrwNA9nKZjviggok=\"}},\"text\":\"- Teaching presence - During a call, I facilitate the class and guide the lesson, ensuring we keep on task.Starting discussion topics, asking guiding questions and offering help if required.There are a lot of benefits to a digital and collaborative online class environment.One of the biggest for the Developers Institute is equity and accessibility.All our students can access tertiary education no matter where they are located in the country.We provide them with a computer for the entirety of the course.The only other things they need to have are a good internet connection and a quiet place to study.If they have whānau they care for outside of a large centre, they are not disadvantaged.If they have young children to care for, they are not disadvantaged.They interact with learners and a teaching team located all over Aotearoa (New Zealand) with a wide diverse range of learners from all stages of life and cultures.The most challenging aspect of a digital remote online class environment is ensuring students actively engage in learning and get the required help.While remote, it may seem more challenging to keep an eye on how learners are engaging and progressing in their studies, but in fact, it's quite the opposite these days with the number of available tools we employ.For starters, we can track each learner's progress through their online classroom material in iQualify, and see those needing encouragement or help.View the progress of their exercise via GitHub Classroom, and offer relevant feedback specific to the context of their work.Keep in contact regularly via Slack and Google Meet.We also have a team that can answer their questions via a ticketing system and quickly get the learners the help they need.These tools are necessary to offer the level of support we do.To further the learning experience, I follow contemporary pedagogies in my teaching process.For example, I have used constructionism in my classes by running \\\"mob programming\\\" lessons where I get the learners to develop a web form using an online integrated development environment or IDE for short.This tool, called Replit allows the learners to collaborate on the same codebase in real time together.It will enable multiple people to work on the same code file simultaneously.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"Z/lR6oH2IbwhSa6R9OBu1GjjzHJK5K+WMDZZ0n/p9KQ=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"01601e43-37d6-4508-97e1-c3bffd8b7139":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"01601e43-37d6-4508-97e1-c3bffd8b7139\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/reflecting-practice-instructor.md\",\"file_name\":\"reflecting-practice-instructor.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/reflecting-practice-instructor.md_1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/reflecting-practice-instructor.md\",\"file_name\":\"reflecting-practice-instructor.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"147gTsCY2YVGn58PlXXRt6QZAQlLcnGarKoqrIcgsI8=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"1c51fe02-a53e-4263-ab95-e2b6f6ed8618\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/reflecting-practice-instructor.md\",\"file_name\":\"reflecting-practice-instructor.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"lLQ2Hvm7xHBOHiVpY5pGopQIPhI3lBgQTb4HlPMfJ1U=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"8e759687-178b-48e7-bf2a-f606eecc376e\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"KX0HlijjD1JUG6x6U/pqeM/7nm3RMygGew9Dv8gCM/E=\"}},\"text\":\"It will enable multiple people to work on the same code file simultaneously.In conjunction with a video call, I can facilitate the class and let the learners take turns, discuss and suggest to one another what steps should be taken to build the web form.What I find in my classes in this scenario as learners help one another and discuss the merits of what they have built.The Learners who aren't always vocal engage more in the comfortable, collaborative scenario.The tool works well in an online situation and would also be good in an in-person computer lab situation.In our final paper, the capstone course, we create a learning environment internal to the Developers Institute and with other partners where we get the learners to work on a project over eight weeks.We use constructivism in this project in the case of the Developers Institute, where it's a collaboration effort with our engineering team and a small group of students.The engineer from the Developers Institute will outline a project brief of more than half the elements the learners already know what to do.But the learners must research and learn about specific portions of the project to complete it.The engineer will be on hand to work with the group to give them the guidance they need when appropriate, but they are free to use new concepts and ideas to achieve the goal of completing the project brief.This uses the idea of Vygotsky’s zone of proximal development[^2], where the learner can do with the guidance of a knowledgeable other, in this case, the engineer from the Developers Institute.We combine the capstone course with the use of experiential learning theory as well.The learners are asked to complete the project and present their progress and findings with a fortnightly demonstration to staff and stakeholders at the Developers Institute.This is in conjunction with a portfolio assessment where they are asked to reflect on their learning and experience building out the project over the eight weeks.Both experiential learning and constructivism have some disadvantages, hence why we don't use them until the last project of a capstone, where we are focused on getting the learners to focus on how they can learn new concepts or technologies they haven't used before and how to apply them in context of a software solution.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"28GBYQmIfv8z2xSGdD8ah4vB4I0TJbB2KQWLsdk4Pzk=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"8e759687-178b-48e7-bf2a-f606eecc376e":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"8e759687-178b-48e7-bf2a-f606eecc376e\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/reflecting-practice-instructor.md\",\"file_name\":\"reflecting-practice-instructor.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/reflecting-practice-instructor.md_1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/reflecting-practice-instructor.md\",\"file_name\":\"reflecting-practice-instructor.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"147gTsCY2YVGn58PlXXRt6QZAQlLcnGarKoqrIcgsI8=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"01601e43-37d6-4508-97e1-c3bffd8b7139\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/reflecting-practice-instructor.md\",\"file_name\":\"reflecting-practice-instructor.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"49rLvJZOCBKt/LxzLD3x7gVCK5jrrwNA9nKZjviggok=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"d3577a72-8cb8-4f9c-9189-c9385be054fe\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"+am9RrTpwPMDZzcxKbJ2JWgiDUVQ2Oxf4AIYd/oikc0=\"}},\"text\":\"Using them too early in the course would require too much core knowledge and would be totally reliant on the engineer (knowledgeable other) to help build the project.At the end of the course, they have covered all the core knowledge over previous terms and can quite easily make a small web app with authorisation and implement an API with database write and read functionality.Because the groups are relatively small, we can be more confident that all the students will have meaningful experiences concerning experiential learning.Also, with the learning experience happening outside of a traditional classroom setting, we negate constructionism's limitations where the learners can focus on the learning by doing.Finally, sustainability is something that we want to impart to our learners at Developer Institute.Sustainability can cover many things regarding education, but the two areas I'd like to highlight in my teaching practice are sustainable learning and the sustainability of the environment.Regarding education, we wish to make learning sustainable for our learners to succeed in their work lives in the fast-changing world of software development.What was once the current framework of choice this year could be out of favour the next.As our learners will experience many changes throughout their careers, finding relevant information on upcoming technologies is fundamental to being ready for this.This is a challenging task; unfortunately, we suggest recommended sources such as the W3C, the Mozilla developers network and how to find relevant information on programming languages.On top of those resources, it pays to form networking groups of your peers in both school alumni and other thought leaders in their fields, whether by social media, forums, or simply following trending libraries and frameworks on GitHub.The other aspect of sustainability we wish to encourage in our learners is the sustainability of the environment.One significant part of that is fundamental in how Developers Institute operates as a remote-only school.A high number of our learners, after graduating, look for remote-only jobs as that is how they feel most comfortable working after spending one or two years learning remotely.EECA attest[^3], \\\"Over 50% of New Zealand's energy-related emissions come from transport.Burning fossil fuels like petrol and diesel

ID for the product, before redirecting to Stripe requesting with our private Stripe key.In the previous step we have a form with a price ID value that we can post to this new `checkout_sessions.js` API route.On the product page we need to add the Stripe front-end library which generates a new shopping object.Let's first install via the terminal:\\n\\n```shell\\nnpm install --save @stripe/stripe-js\\n```\\n\\nOnce that's been added we can then add the following to the `index.js` file to create a Stripe object.Make sure it sits outside the component for the page.```js\\n// import stripe js\\nimport { loadStripe } from \\\"@stripe/stripe-js\\\";\\n\\n// Make sure to call `loadStripe` outside of a component’s render to avoid\\n// recreating the `Stripe` object on every render.const stripePromise = loadStripe(\\n  `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}`\\n);\\n```\\n\\nWe now need to create the following pages `success.js` and `canceled.js` to be added to the `pages` folder.The `success.js` file will have the following:\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport Head from \\\"next/head\\\";\\nimport Link from \\\"next/link\\\";\\nimport { Layout } from \\\"../components/layout\\\";\\n\\nexport default function Success() {\\n  return (\\n    <>\\n      <Head>\\n        <title>Order Success</title>\\n        <meta name=\\\"description\\\"

the `checkout_sessions.js` file we supply a `success_url` and a `canceled_url` value.This is where we redirect the user from the checkout page.When you click on the \\\"Buy Now\\\" button you will be redirected to the Stripe checkout, like in the image below.{% image \\\"./stripe-checkout.png\\\", \\\"The hosted Stripe checkout\\\" %}\\n\\nIf you complete the purchase, then you will be directed to the success page.{% image \\\"./order-success.png\\\", \\\"Successful order\\\" %}\\n\\nOtherwise if you click the left arrow / back you will be redirected to the cancel page.{% image \\\"./canceled-order.png\\\", \\\"Canceled order\\\" %}\\n\\nWe have now completed the display of products and have the checkout page working correctly.Well done.👏\\n\\nYou can checkout the GitHub repository for this project to see the finished result.Please note there are branches for each step.Alternatively you can view the repository on CodeSandbox.For more help with setting up Stripe

%}\\n\\nyoutube.com/embed/OiHx3Zouj_w\\n\\nContinuing with the Next.js & Stripe online shop series we now will display the products.\\n\\nWe first need to get the products from Stripe and we need to do that securely and not expose our secret Stripe key.\\nSo let's start with creating a new file called `products.js` in the `/pages/api/` folder.\\n\\nWe need to install the **stripe** NPM package first. Run the following command to install it:\\n\\n```shell\\nnpm install --save stripe\\n```\\n\\nAdd the following to the `products.js` file:\\n\\n```js\\nconst stripe = require(\\\"stripe\\\")(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);\\n\\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\\n  try {\\n    const products = await stripe.products.list({\\n      limit: 100,\\n    });\\n\\n    res.status(200).json(products);\\n  } catch (err) {\\n    res.status(500).json({ message: err.message });\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nBy default the products can only be retrieved on the same origin ensuring that only our own shop can retrieve the products.\\n\\nLet's test our API retrieves our products when running locally. You should be able to see the JSON returned.\\n\\n{% image \\\"./product-api.png\\\", \\\"Response from the product API\\\" %}\\n\\nBefore we do anything else we need to create a _HOST_ environment variable. Open the `.env.local` file and add the following:\\n\\n```shell\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":1742,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"I0O6ZOzK7WXAJaWh9Ocg4GvtddzMKz7gUNWFEIqWCQY=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"2e1d1084-9548-4e01-ae53-4eddff163e9d":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"2e1d1084-9548-4e01-ae53-4eddff163e9d\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md\",\"file_name\":\"shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md_2\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md\",\"file_name\":\"shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"6+bNdsvFI1tZhnqw6XzEuSp6MU7pq4ayd1JUpe380jM=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"bdaa6a2e-5107-4700-8243-52786f88e6c7\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"NbT1mzBQ63pAWwzx33E7PhukOE+J2DgPxpVD8wyEV28=\"}},\"text\":\"# add HOST\\nHOST=http://localhost:3000\\n```\\n\\nWe will use the _HOST_ environment variable now, to prepend to our request to the API.Let's update the `index.js` file in the `pages` directory and add the following (outlined in the orange comments):\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport Head from \\\"next/head\\\";\\nimport { Layout } from \\\"../components/layout\\\";\\n\\n// Pass the products object to the Home page\\nexport default function Home({ products }) {\\n  return (\\n    <>\\n      <Head>\\n        <title>Products</title>\\n        <meta name=\\\"description\\\" content=\\\"Products\\\" />\\n      </Head>\\n      <Layout>\\n        {/* Need to pass products.data to the Products component */}\\n        <Products products={products.data} />\\n      </Layout>\\n    </>\\n  );\\n}\\n// Add getServerSideProps so we can return the data from server-side\\nexport async function getServerSideProps() {\\n  // Fetch data from external API\\n  const res = await fetch(`${process.env.HOST}/api/products`);\\n  const products = await res.json();\\n\\n  // Pass data to the page via props\\n  return { props: { products } };\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis will retrieve the products via a server side request so the page can pre-render.We now need a component to display this product information.To do this we will create a new javascript file called `products.js` in the `components` folder.```jsx\\nimport React from \\\"react\\\";\\nimport Image from \\\"next/image\\\";\\nimport styles from \\\"../styles/products.module.css\\\";\\n\\nexport const Products = ({ products }) => {\\n  return (\\n    <>\\n      {/* Check that we have products */}\\n      {products.length ?(\\n        <ul className={styles.products}>\\n          {/* Iterate over the products

<div>No products</div>\\n      )}\\n    </>\\n  );\\n};\\n```\\n\\nNotice in the above example we take advantage of the Next.js Image component.This component is great for displaying optimised versions of your images serving the correct sized image for the device/screen they are being served to.We also need to create a CSS module for the product component, create a new file called `products.module.css` in the `styles` folder.```css\\n.link {\\n  display: inline-block;\\n  background-color: var(--primary-color);\\n  color: #fff;\\n  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;\\n  border-radius: 0.2rem;\\n  border: 1px solid var(--primary-color);\\n}\\n.link:hover {\\n  background-color: #fff;\\n  color: var(--primary-color);\\n}\\n.promotion {\\n  display: grid;\\n  grid-template-columns: 1fr;\\n  list-style: none;\\n  gap: 1rem;\\n  padding: 0;\\n}\\n@media screen and (min-width: 50rem) {\\n  .promotion {\\n    /* 2 columns */\\n    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;\\n  }\\n}\\n@media screen and (min-width: 70rem) {\\n  .promotion {\\n    /* 3 columns */\\n    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe last step to get our images to display from Stripe is to update the `next.config.js` file with a parameter to allow us to retrieve the images from stripe.com.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"qG7Bhdi0T/YPwDadzplOEDawXwiul9IrOfWkw4fLwdM=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"ac1e85b1-a645-4212-9bb3-68347a916766":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"ac1e85b1-a645-4212-9bb3-68347a916766\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md\",\"file_name\":\"shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md_2\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md\",\"file_name\":\"shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"6+bNdsvFI1tZhnqw6XzEuSp6MU7pq4ayd1JUpe380jM=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"bdaa6a2e-5107-4700-8243-52786f88e6c7\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md\",\"file_name\":\"shop-nextjs-stripe-display-products.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"NbT1mzBQ63pAWwzx33E7PhukOE+J2DgPxpVD8wyEV28=\"}},\"text\":\"config.js`

available like the following:\\n\\n{% image \\\"./shop-with-products.png\\\", \\\"Products listed\\\" %}\\n\\nOur products are displaying now because we used `getServerSideProps` to retrieve the products server side.The product information is retrieved before rendering and served server side (information will be displayed even if JavaScript is disabled).Great for search engines to be able to

may have built a website before using the likes of Create React App which will get you the bare bones together to start building.But it doesn't get you that far before you have a huge amount of decisions to make.What routing should I use for my pages?What CSS in JS library?Should I use Tailwind?Will my website have good SEO?Very quickly you can be overloaded with decisions.This stems mostly from the fact that React is not a framework.It's a _library_.Next.js on the other hand is **\\\"The React Framework for Production\\\"**.With it a lot of the decisions have been made for you, letting you get up and running much faster.More importantly it solves a lot of the common problems that building a website/web app entail.You will need to have an understanding of HTML, CSS and React of course to follow along with this series.I teach all these subjects at Developers Institute where I'm a Tech Lead 😉\\n\\nTo get started building a Next.js application, hopefully you have Node installed ( if not download here ) and open up your terminal.```shell\\nnpx create-next-app@latest\\n```\\n\\nFollow the prompts and give it a name \\\"shop-nextjs-stripe\\\"\\n\\nHead into the directory with your new project and start the local development.```shell\\ncd shop-nextjs-stripe\\nnpm run dev\\n```\\n\\nOpen your code editor and take a look at the folder structure.You will see 3

This will show the content from that component.Your **pages** folder will have a **api** folder and two files `_app.js` and `index.js`.Open the project in a browser and you should see something like this\\n\\n{% image \\\"./nextjs-start.png\\\", \\\"Next.JS Starter\\\" %}\\n\\nGreat the project is up and running in development mode 🙌\\n\\nIn your code editor (I suggest you use VS Code) we will open the `index.js` file in the `pages` folder.We are going to remove everything and replace it with the following:\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport Head from \\\"next/head\\\";\\n\\nexport default function Home() {\\n  return (\\n    <>\\n      <Head>\\n        <title>Products</title>\\n        <meta name=\\\"description\\\" content=\\\"Products\\\" />\\n      </Head>\\n    </>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThat's cleared the standard install documentation links.Time to make our first component.Let's make a new folder called `components` and add a file `layout.js` in that directory.Add the following:\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport React from \\\"react\\\";\\nimport Head from \\\"next/head\\\";\\n\\nimport styles from \\\"../styles/layout.module.css\\\";\\n\\nexport const Layout = ({ children }) => {\\n  return (\\n    <>\\n      <Head>\\n        <link rel=\\\"icon\\\" href=\\\"/favicon.ico\\\" />\\n      </Head>\\n      <div className={styles.container}>\\n        <main className={styles.main}>{children}</main>\\n      </div>\\n    </>\\n  );\\n};\\n```\\n\\nThis will be the layout shared across all our pages in the shop.To add to that we will add a Header and a Footer component.Again in the `components` folder create a `header.js` and a `footer.js` file.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"AHJPenaOeLIm0xs+a6emrqJq9jbinNolNB1CR6npdwE=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"07034afa-7b7e-42eb-8f7d-075c6e5d93d1":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"07034afa-7b7e-42eb-8f7d-075c6e5d93d1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/shop-nextjs-stripe-introduction.md\",\"file_name\":\"shop-nextjs-stripe-introduction.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/shop-nextjs-stripe-introduction.md_1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/shop-nextjs-stripe-introduction.md\",\"file_name\":\"shop-nextjs-stripe-introduction.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"uahXRWF88Vuojpne7BZcIS6NC3OCPggVmZCcn72+ur0=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"f6fe8707-ba7e-4faf-95ba-45fac717b258\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/shop-nextjs-stripe-introduction.md\",\"file_name\":\"shop-nextjs-stripe-introduction.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"iwkfhJBpXeUTcmWOK2fnELtg2JNZQ8uiUThVzKZ34OI=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"e8504eb7-a12d-49e4-9a89-5a875e0ffe3c\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"XgcII1uPAWUcaJVT9GC7FHiUnRkDCnGoEYZJuNMkz5A=\"}},\"text\":\"js` and a `footer.js` file.In the header file add the following:\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport React from \\\"react\\\";\\n\\nexport const Header = () => {\\n  return <header></header>;\\n};\\n```\\n\\nIn the footer file add the following:\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport React from \\\"react\\\";\\n\\nexport const Footer = () => {\\n  return <footer></footer>;\\n};\\n```\\n\\nWe need to update the layout component like so (see the comments in the code):\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport React from \\\"react\\\";\\nimport Head from \\\"next/head\\\";\\n\\n// Add the following imports\\nimport { Header } from \\\"./header\\\";\\nimport { Footer } from \\\"./footer\\\";\\n\\nimport styles from \\\"../styles/layout.module.css\\\";\\n\\nexport const Layout = ({ children }) => {\\n  return (\\n    <>\\n

className={styles.main}>{children}</main>\\n      </div>\\n      {/* Add the Footer */}\\n      <Footer />\\n    </>\\n  );\\n};\\n```\\n\\nWe now have a Layout component we can re-use throughout our application with the Header and Footer on every page.We can pass the content for the page via the **children** prop.You may have noticed we have a reference to a CSS module but haven't added that to the `styles` folder yet.By default Next.js supports CSS modules, the major benefit with CSS modules is we can avoid CSS name collisions (it makes unique CSS class names) and feel comfortable to delete an unused CSS file as we know it's only relevant to one component.CSS Tricks has a series on CSS Modules worth reading to get a better understanding.Notice that the corresponding CSS classes above are referenced as a JavaScript object e.g.```jsx\\n<div className={styles.container}>\\n```\\n\\nLet's add the CSS and it's file.Create a `layout.module.css` file in the `styles` folder with the following code:\\n\\n```css\\n.container {\\n  min-height: 90vh;\\n  display: flex;\\n  flex-direction: column;\\n  justify-content: flex-start;\\n}\\n.main {\\n  padding:

page.Let's add it to the `index.js`:\\n\\n```js\\nimport Head from \\\"next/head\\\";\\nimport styles from \\\"../styles/Home.module.css\\\";\\n\\n// Import the layout components\\nimport { Layout } from \\\"../components/layout\\\";\\n\\nexport default function Home() {\\n  return (\\n    <>\\n      <Head>\\n        <title>Products</title>\\n        <meta name=\\\"description\\\" content=\\\"Products\\\" />\\n      </Head>\\n\\n      {/* Add the Layout component to the Home page.*/}\\n      <Layout></Layout>\\n    </>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\nLet's start putting some content in to the Header component.Let's start off by adding some `<div>` tags to store a logo and some icons.```jsx\\nimport React from \\\"react\\\";\\n\\nimport styles from \\\"../styles/header.module.css\\\";\\n\\nexport const Header = () => {\\n  return (\\n    <header className={styles.header}>\\n      <div className={styles.mainNav}>\\n        <div

height: 4.4rem;\\n  border-bottom: 1px solid #eaeaea;\\n  display: flex;\\n  justify-content: center;\\n  align-items: center;\\n  position: fixed;\\n  background-color: var(--bg-color);\\n  z-index:

var(--max-cont-width);\\n}\\n.logo {\\n  color: var(--font-color);\\n  cursor: pointer;\\n  width: 4rem;\\n  height: 4rem;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWe also need to update the `global.css` file with these

videos, tutorials, exercises and quizzes).You lean into technology is how.Every week new tools are released that you can incorporate into your education practices.We have seen the most significant growth in Machine Learning technology with the increase in the ability of Large Language Models at an almost frightening pace.Since late last year, we have seen huge jumps in the capability of generative AI art models to produce fantastic images from simple text prompts.We have seen all the GPT (Generative pre-trained transformer) tools like ChatGPT, for example, that given short text prompts can produce answers for simple facts to writing history essays.What’s even more exciting is the adoption of the technology companies adding these capabilities to products we already use and love.AI answers have now been incorporated into searches on Bing and Google, so your answers are provided directly in the search engine itself.Adobe has added generative image creation into Photoshop to create extraordinary images with text prompts.Canva can produce multiple templates on the fly from a user uploading an image and some colour prompts.We have benefitted significantly at Developers

digital technology in our teaching practices.But there are still more tools we can embrace to benefit the learners.One of these ways is to incorporate ChatGPT as another tool for our students to get support in their learning, exercises and projects.With ChatGPT, there can always be help available to answer questions at any time.ChatGPT was trained on a large portion of code on GitHub, the collaborative version control software that hosts an extensive collection of open-source projects.Because of this, it can answer most questions about code syntax and provide examples for learners.Say a learner wanted to know how to fetch some data in a format called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) using the JavaScript programming language.They could ask this to ChatGPT, which would explain with an example code like in the screenshot below.The answer has a step-by-step breakdown of what needs to happen, an example snippet of code and a summary explaining how it works.{% figure \\\"./js-fetch-chatgpt.png\\\", \\\"ChatGPT fetch example\\\" %}\\n\\nTo ensure new and existing learners can take advantage of this incredible technology, we are planning on creating a supplementary course in our learner management system that will cover the following items (Fraiwan et al., 2023)[^1]:\\n\\n- Personalised learning experiences: Tools like ChatGPT can help by suggesting learning resources, addressing student inquiries and offering feedback.- Code Generation: Like in the previous example above, ChatGPT can help solve coding problems or provide guidance on how to approach a programming problem.The learner can describe a problem in words and/or code snippets to help solve an issue.- Debugging: Assist in identifying errors and suggesting fixes.The course will be a mix of documentation on advising on how to write prompts for ChatGPT and video screencast tutorials where teach leads (our industry-aligned name for teachers) in our teaching team will walk through real-life examples and demonstrations on common issues our learners have previously had.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"/lZ+bGqUXv7wnoxSjfVEiChgKeYzTKqmsPvicGLl6bk=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"35110553-bff4-4819-9066-2437fe01a6ae":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"35110553-bff4-4819-9066-2437fe01a6ae\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/teaching-software-development-with-ai.md\",\"file_name\":\"teaching-software-development-with-ai.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/teaching-software-development-with-ai.md_1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/teaching-software-development-with-ai.md\",\"file_name\":\"teaching-software-development-with-ai.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"ABaUDJcKPZPqpOYhHBanUYhj9QQ/o/ioqylUNof/PPA=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"e8ff1fd0-7895-468d-b2ff-380befa86418\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/teaching-software-development-with-ai.md\",\"file_name\":\"teaching-software-development-with-ai.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"fEWIqcMvZvc0yzX93YqovF8jzuRtaq6V8+/TkHIfw7g=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"dfcb559e-ebb1-4f81-b9fa-3d4b0e6e0bc1\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"eRVm3h9niziYFG+hvcJH7R5wBzGgwjs85oae0GUyWtI=\"}},\"text\":\"Just like learners would have previously learnt how to use a search engine like Google, they will be taught how to interact with ChatGPT and what prompts can elicit different responses.While ChatGPT is a valuable tool, we will also have to remind our learners that it is an early technology tool and not infallible, it still has issues with “hallucinations” of facts that are entirely fabricated, a concept popularised by Google AI researchers (Agarwal et al., 2018)[^2].Learners must verify answers with reliable sources, official documentation, or via our learner support team.GitHub Copilot is a plugin for Visual Studio Code, the IDE (integrated development environment) we use at the Developers Institute.It is an extension of a developer's work environment and acts as an AI pair programmer that helps one write code.It does this by prompting suggested code based on the context of your existing code and interpreting code comments.It will show this suggested code in the grey text beside the cursor.If it seems satisfactory, pressing the tab key will embed this suggestion into your code base.The suggestions can be from a simple line to multiple lines, depending on what the AI model predicts you will use.It will also suggest multiple options, generally more than one.If unhappy, use the “Next\\\" suggestion keyboard shortcut.The predictions/suggestions will even use the declared variables in your existing code.{% figure \\\"./vscode-copilot.png\\\", \\\"Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot\\\" %}\\n\\nThe benefits that most developers find when using Copilot are the following:\\n\\n- Productivity increased: Copilot can improve productivity by providing context-relevant code suggestions when needed.Stopping a developer from needing to switch contexts and having to look up documentation (Peng et al., 2023)[^3].- Generating tests: When writing code for software development, it is best practice to write tests to ensure your code is working correctly.Often this can be a mind-numbing task doing simple checks to ensure that when two known values are passed to a function, the expected results are always the same every time the function is run.You can ensure this is the case by writing tests (small pieces of code to check) that test the boundaries of happy and negative

is integrated into your IDE, so it is aware of your code's functions.It knows the expected parameters and can generate these small tests, saving lots of time on repetitive coding (Wermelinger, 2023)[^4].We plan to integrate Copilot with the previously mentioned course with ChatGPT.Again adding screencasts and tutorials on how to make the most of it.This course will be called \\\"Enhancing Development with AI\\\", which we plan to be 2-3 weeks of content and can be completed after our first program in the student's software development journey as a supplementary self-paced online course.That way, existing students and new learners alike can up-skill.Another great tool that enables collaborative learning between students and teaching staff is GitHub Codespaces.It is a cloud-based development environment.It allows you to code as if using Visual Studio Code, in the cloud via a browser (or your local copy of VS Code).There is no need to set up a local environment to

multiple-tier applications from an iPad or Chromebook as the code runs in the cloud.- Rapid onboarding and sharing: Students and staff can quickly set up and start working on a shared project or exercise in a class without the hassle of setting up a local development environment.The Codespaces can be configured with all tools and dependencies near instantly.- Collaboration and code review: It's common to support our learners by needing to run their exercise or project to help them debug.We must find their Git repository, clone it locally to our local development environment (computer), and install all the dependencies to provide support.With Codespaces, we can quickly deploy in the cloud and share the same code in seconds.In the long term, we plan to migrate our existing exercises

many exercises to convert, it will take some time to complete.Finally, we want to embed environmentally sustainable software practises into our course.We want to minimise the impact of software systems on our environment by reducing energy consumption and using green energy, reducing carbon emissions.There are several ways to do this:\\n\\n- Green (Cloud) Hosting: Choosing environmentally friendly hosting options.For example, Microsoft is powering their data centres with carbon-zero power and has just signed a 10-year power purchase agreement with Contact Energy to supply geothermal energy (NZX, 2023)[^6].- Energy efficiency and optimisation: Teach energy-efficient programming practices and techniques where resources are minimised, and we attempt to reduce unnecessary compute time.Thus reducing the energy consumption of servers (Abhishek et al., 2021)[^7].- Promote reduced cost: By optimising efficiency, the software can require smaller servers to reduce the cost of hosting.The reduced cost benefit is an easy sell to employers.If each graduate can help make environmentally sustainable efforts for software development in Aotearoa more common, we can get a little closer to our reduction of greenhouse gas emissions goals of 2030, and reduce the impact of climate change.In conclusion, as a remote school heavily relying on technology, it's important to continue innovating in education to enhance the student's learning experience.We need to educate students in tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to assist and support them when practising to become software developers.Allowing collaboration and learning to be more accessible to staff and learners by easily sharing their current issue(s) without frustration and hassle using Codespaces.We need them to go into the industry with a good grasp of environmental sustainability concerning software development to help with impending climate change.Incorporating these tools and knowledge into our teaching practices will ensure Developers Institute is at the forefront of digital and collaborative learning.[^1]: Mohammad Fraiwan, Natheer Khasawneh (2023).A Review of ChatGPT Applications in Education,

introduction to what Tailwind CSS is, and its pros & cons.socialBackground: bg2\\nogimage: \\\"TailwindFlexboxCover.jpg\\\"\\n---\\n\\nTailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that can provide many benefits for a web development project.It lets you style your HTML content by appending a multitude of predefined utility CSS classes to your HTML elements.For example say you were creating a Card component with a heading, description and image using ReactJS.```jsx\\nconst Card = ({ heading, description, image }) => {\\n  return (\\n    <div className=\\\"cardContainer\\\">\\n      <img src={image} className=\\\"cardImage\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" />\\n      <div>\\n        <h3 className=\\\"cardHeading\\\">{heading}</h3>\\n        <div className=\\\"cardDescription\\\">{description}</div>\\n      </div>\\n    </div>\\n  );\\n};\\n```\\n\\nUsing standard CSS we would create classes for all the elements in our Card component like the example above.This would require us to create these individual classes in a CSS file.In this scenario there are two things that need to be done:\\n\\n1.Name our CSS class names: Naming can be difficult, especially when multiple team members are involved.It can lead to confusion, for example, if one person refers to a component as a \\\"tile\\\" and another calls it a \\\"card.\\\"2.Duplication: Repeating the same CSS properties multiple times throughout the CSS file(s) e.g.`margin: 0` and `padding: 1rem` we can end up with a mess that most developers on your team would be afraid to change for fear of regression issues.```css\\n.cardContainer {\\n  border-radius: 0.75rem;\\n  display: flex;\\n  gap: 0.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"E9Phx0mQfu7QqSxZoha1yXehbbI7yi84ckPYhmCHA2k=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"797a12c3-401d-468a-adc4-a5b0fb1f8610":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"797a12c3-401d-468a-adc4-a5b0fb1f8610\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/what-is-tailwind-css.md\",\"file_name\":\"what-is-tailwind-css.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/what-is-tailwind-css.md_1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/what-is-tailwind-css.md\",\"file_name\":\"what-is-tailwind-css.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"grIa3gLFGgkPfZPirj5E0XLfe4U7MOiagXeQF13eD40=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"531bf03f-44d8-4b06-b9e0-ddda6d2b6127\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/what-is-tailwind-css.md\",\"file_name\":\"what-is-tailwind-css.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"E9Phx0mQfu7QqSxZoha1yXehbbI7yi84ckPYhmCHA2k=\"}},\"text\":\"75rem;\\n

see such a mess of CSS classes for each HTML element.But each class is easy to remember as they map to existing CSS properties, and will not be repeated in the CSS file.```jsx\\nconst Card = ({ heading, description, image }) => {\\n  return (\\n    <div className=\\\"rounded-xl shadow-lg bg-white p-4 mb-4 flex gap-2\\\">\\n      <img src={image} className=\\\"rounded-lg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"

Why should I use Tailwind CSS?\\n\\nSo why would you use Tailwind and pollute your components with all these class names?\\n\\nThe most common answer to why is you don't have to worry about naming classes or naming collisions in your CSS. Instead you can just get on with using the CSS properties you already know and set about applying them to your HTML elements. You don't even need to view the CSS file. You can just remain working on the component with the occasional look at the Tailwind documentation.\\n\\nSome more reasons to use Tailwind CSS are:\\n\\n- DRY: No repetition of code in your CSS files, `margin-left: 1rem` is only declared once in your stylesheet. CSS property declarations are DRY so aren't repeated\\n- Lack of confusion: No confusion of naming as all members of the team use the pre-existing CSS class names instead of creating new CSS classes\\n- Speed: Tailwind CSS provides pre-defined CSS classes that can be used to quickly style elements, allowing developers to focus on building the structure and functionality of their website or application.\\n- Consistency: By using the same pre-defined classes throughout the project, developers can ensure that the design is consistent across all pages and components.\\n- Customization: Tailwind CSS allows developers to customize the default styles and generate new classes with specific variations, giving more flexibility and control over the design.\\n- Accessibility: Tailwind CSS provides a set of utility classes to help implement accessibility best practices, such as providing sufficient contrast and using semantic HTML elements.\\n- Performance: Tailwind CSS allows you to only include the CSS you need (via a clever build process), leading to smaller CSS file sizes and faster load times for your website or application.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"startCharIdx\":2,\"endCharIdx\":1782,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"tetiq48vqVLosEL43SKB9/NTjIrXZ3zsGMsXYDhaWj4=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"bf4ec08d-fea0-4f35-bb74-5f11b3a68fcb":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"bf4ec08d-fea0-4f35-bb74-5f11b3a68fcb\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/what-is-tailwind-css.md\",\"file_name\":\"what-is-tailwind-css.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/what-is-tailwind-css.md_3\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/what-is-tailwind-css.md\",\"file_name\":\"what-is-tailwind-css.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"SoOqUAyn4BB/HTyI8fIKSgL4Tx7EgDcbklvo3Lq57W8=\"}},\"text\":\"## What makes the Tailwind CSS developer experience (DX) good?\\n\\nIn terms of developer experience once you get over it looking like horrible **tag soup** with all those CSS classes scattered through your HTML/JSX files you will start to notice a couple of things:\\n\\n- Tailwind CSS is ideal in team situations. By default, you don't have naming conflicts and there are no confusion about names as styling is done at the property level.\\n- The use of the Tailwind Labs official plugin for VS Code enable autocomplete functionality. If you already know the name of CSS properties and have used the likes of Bootstrap for padding and margin you will quickly feel familiar with Tailwind.\\n- Another benefit is that you aren't changing the CSS, instead you are working on the HTML so there is little chance of breaking styling for other parts of your website.\\n- You will only have to do a minimal amount of CSS work for the likes of theming or specific custom styles which means your CSS won't grow in size much at all. In fact with the build process your HTML can be scanned to look for the CSS classes and determine if they are not used and can be removed from the CSS file of the website. Therefore only creating a CSS file with the CSS classes used.\\n- As the padding and margin values are predefined you won't get the same padding value declared multiple times scattered through your CSS file. You can also check at a glance are elements sharing the same padding or margin by the CSS classes applied without having to use the browser dev tools or find the class in the CSS.\\n- No need to write media queries as instead you can use the utility classes outlined here in the vein of `md:w-32` to only apply the CSS class on the page being **medium** sized.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"startCharIdx\":2,\"endCharIdx\":1748,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"pYyplEDzUibxt51Ghx9xEJWOdsFQfzqWkoFXU1LbohM=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"057cd38c-937e-4b85-9073-018696312d59":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"057cd38c-937e-4b85-9073-018696312d59\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/what-is-tailwind-css.md\",\"file_name\":\"what-is-tailwind-css.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/what-is-tailwind-css.md_4\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/what-is-tailwind-css.md\",\"file_name\":\"what-is-tailwind-css.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"6AyVAsif1slAFizsovxiws5+Jgf9UnOdHWd2mz1sMnY=\"}},\"text\":\"## When should I use Tailwind CSS?\\n\\nBased on my experience, Tailwind CSS is most effective when used on a team where some or most of the developers have limited CSS skills.

What are the downsides of Tailwind CSS?Although Tailwind CSS offers many benefits, there are some drawbacks that could affect both the short-term and long-term success of your project:\\n\\n- File size: Tailwind requires a large number of CSS classes to be added to your HTML, which can lead to longer page load times and larger file sizes if not optimized properly.- Learning curve: Tailwind CSS requires a different approach to writing CSS, which can take some time to learn and adjust to.- Opinionated design: Tailwind CSS provides pre-defined classes that can be used to quickly style elements, but it also imposes a specific design aesthetic that may not align with the desired look and feel of the website or application.- Overuse of classes: Using too many classes on a single element can make the HTML difficult to read and understand, leading to a more complex and harder to maintain codebase.- Customization: Tailwind CSS is highly customizable, but this can also lead to increased complexity in terms of configuration, and can make it harder to maintain the design consistency across the project.- Hard to remove: It can be challenging to remove Tailwind CSS once it has been implemented.This is because the embedded Tailwind classes are present throughout your HTML, component, or template files, and removing them incrementally can create conflicts with the Tailwind build system.Additionally, it may further complicate the project by requiring an additional build process for the new setup to incrementally replace styling.- Waiting on bleeding edge CSS features: Recent years have seen significant advancements in browser CSS capabilities, such as Container Queries, `:has()`, and Subgrid.While these features can enhance the design and functionality of a website, they can be difficult to implement using Tailwind.In some cases, it may be necessary to wait for them to become available in Tailwind or make changes to the implementation once they are supported.- Native is forever: When incorporating a new framework like Tailwind into a project, it will require a learning phase.However, it's important to note that the knowledge acquired is specific to the Tailwind framework, including its class names and naming conventions, which may not be transferable to other frameworks.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"qRgyJ/Yuu/d+aC1OZg2hOf7hOWMdeDpjpLxVDzT0JVg=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"cf9ef276-f282-41ad-bce1-d1c5dcc93c43":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"cf9ef276-f282-41ad-bce1-d1c5dcc93c43\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/what-is-tailwind-css.md\",\"file_name\":\"what-is-tailwind-css.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/what-is-tailwind-css.md_5\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/what-is-tailwind-css.md\",\"file_name\":\"what-is-tailwind-css.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"pY8O9dmGvmY4sOjktj2srQVlz0tQQvQJOj8O6aEvwd8=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"b29d30c8-3860-4802-8165-6ec63b8f9025\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/andrewford-co-nz-chatbot/data/what-is-tailwind-css.md\",\"file_name\":\"what-is-tailwind-css.md\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"qRgyJ/Yuu/d+aC1OZg2hOf7hOWMdeDpjpLxVDzT0JVg=\"}},\"text\":\"On the other hand, using CSS in its native form and understanding its intended use will result in a knowledge that will remain useful for a long time.- Bare-bones by default: What makes Tailwind different to other frameworks like Bootstrap etc is that you will need to create basic components like footers and headers from scratch, unless you pay for TailwindUI.These prebuilt components are not freely available as open source.Instead most build there own components from scratch using the Tailwind CSS classes.Tailwind can be a suitable choice for almost any team, especially those that have no strong lead in CSS.Although it has some drawbacks, it sits between Bootstrap and native CSS in terms of flexibility and appearance.It avoids the common \\\"look and feel\\\" of websites built with Bootstrap, while providing some rails to prevent a large messy CSS file.To get the most out of Tailwind, it is important to adhere to its recommended practices and adjust your process to it's way.If
